# Rotation programmes

Structured assignments where team members work in opposite role for weeks or months. Deep immersion builds empathy, reveals process gaps, and transfers knowledge.

## Programme structure

### Duration options

Short rotation (2-4 weeks): Shadowing and observation. Learn daily work, ask questions, identify quick wins.

Standard rotation (6-8 weeks): Partial ownership. Take on real responsibilities with mentor oversight. Contribute to projects.

Extended rotation (3-6 months): Full role swap. Complete accountability for deliverables. Deep operational experience.

### Selection criteria

Willing participants: Voluntary or at least enthusiastic. Forced rotations breed resentment.

Baseline competency: Technical foundation in own role. Can't cross-train before mastering primary role.

Career development alignment: Rotation supports person's growth goals and career trajectory.

Timing: Business operations permit temporary reassignment. Avoid critical project phases or short-staffed periods.

Management support: Both sending and receiving managers committed to rotation success.

## Objectives and expectations

### Red team → Blue team rotation

Objectives: Understand detection capabilities, learn response procedures, recognise operational constraints, identify blind spots.

Activities: Monitor alerts, investigate suspicious activity, participate in incident response, use SIEM and EDR tools, contribute to detection rule tuning.

Expected outcomes: Better red team operations that test realistic gaps, detection-focused debriefs, improved collaboration with blue team.

### Blue team → Red team rotation

Objectives: Learn offensive techniques, understand attacker mindset, recognise red team operational challenges, build attack simulation skills.

Activities: Conduct reconnaissance, simulate attacks, document operations, provide findings, learn offensive tools.

Expected outcomes: Better detection rules based on offensive understanding, realistic threat modelling, improved response to sophisticated attacks.

## Success measures

Knowledge transfer: Participant can explain opposite team's work, challenges, and priorities to colleagues.

Process improvements: Participant identifies 3-5 actionable improvements based on rotation experience.

Relationship building: Ongoing communication between teams increases after rotation.

Skill development: Participant gains capabilities that enhance primary role performance.

Cultural shift: Decreased "us vs. them" thinking, increased collaboration.

## Common challenges

Coverage gaps: Primary role left short-staffed during rotation. Mitigation: Plan rotations during lower-intensity periods, stagger rotations, ensure backup coverage.

Imposter syndrome: Feeling incompetent in unfamiliar role. Mitigation: Set realistic expectations, pair with mentor, focus on learning not productivity.

Resistance to return: Enjoying new role more than primary role. Mitigation: Frame rotation as development opportunity, not permanent change. Some role changes may be appropriate if mutually beneficial.

Lost productivity: Training period reduces output. Mitigation: Accept productivity dip as investment. Long-term benefits outweigh short-term costs.
