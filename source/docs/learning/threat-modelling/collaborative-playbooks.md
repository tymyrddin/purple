# Collaborative playbooks

Turn exercise insights into living team practices.

## Why collaborative playbooks matter
Exercises only matter if their lessons are applied.
Playbooks capture what works, what fails, and how to respond,
giving teams ready-to-use guidance for real operations.

## Exercise instructions
1. Review observations and lessons from scenario labs, live experiments, and retrospectives.  
2. Document:  
   - Key actions and decision points  
   - Mitigation strategies  
   - Roles and responsibilities  
3. Keep it simple, team-specific, and practical.  
4. Share and review regularly as situations evolve.

## Outcome
Teams leave with actionable playbooks that reflect real learning,
making risk management part of everyday operations.
