# Introduction

Experiment, learn, and apply insights together.

## Why these sessions matter
Threats and operational challenges are best understood by doing, not just talking.  
These collaborative sessions let teams explore scenarios, test assumptions in real time, reflect on lessons, and turn insights into practical guidance.

## How to use this set
1. Work through the sessions in order:  
   - Scenario labs → Live experiments → Rapid retrospectives → Collaborative playbooks.  
2. Focus on practical outputs rather than theory.  
3. Collaborate actively: discussion and observation reveal hidden risks and opportunities.  
4. Capture lessons immediately so the team can apply them right away.

## Outcome
By the end of these sessions, teams will have:  
- A shared understanding of how scenarios might unfold  
- Hands-on experience responding to simulated challenges  
- Immediate lessons captured through reflection  
- Practical playbooks for everyday operations  

These sessions are designed to be iterative and adaptable. Repeat, tweak, and learn continuously to strengthen team readiness and operational resilience.
