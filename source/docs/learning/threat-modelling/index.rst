Teams understand threats best by experiencing them. These collaborative sessions provide a structured way to experiment
with scenarios, explore potential challenges, and observe how adversaries and operational disruptions might play out.
By working together in a safe, guided environment, participants see where processes succeed, where they fail, and which
decisions are most critical.

The sessions are designed to turn observations into action. Through scenario labs, live experiments, rapid retrospectives, and
collaborative playbooks, teams capture insights immediately, reflect on lessons learned, and build practical, reusable guidance.
