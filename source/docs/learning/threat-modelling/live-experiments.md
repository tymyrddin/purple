# Live experiments

Test team responses with controlled, real-time challenges.

## Why live experiments matter
Simulations reveal gaps and strengths that discussion alone cannot.
By experimenting with small, safe disruptions,
teams learn to adapt and respond under realistic conditions.

## Exercise instructions
1. Introduce a controlled disruption: technical, procedural, or simulated adversary action.  
2. Observe team reactions in real time.  
3. Debrief together:  
   - What worked well?  
   - What caused delays or confusion?  
   - How could the process be improved?  

## Outcome
Participants gain first-hand experience with operational challenges,
and teams identify concrete improvements to processes and coordination.
