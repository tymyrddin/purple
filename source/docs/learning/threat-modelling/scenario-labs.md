# Scenario labs

Explore plausible situations and experiment with responses.

## Why scenario labs matter
Seeing risks on paper is not enough.
Scenario labs let teams play out events in a safe environment,
understand adversary behaviour, and spot vulnerabilities early.

## Exercise instructions
1. Select a scenario or attack path relevant to your team.  
2. Run a tabletop or roleplay to explore how it unfolds.  
3. Discuss as a group:  
   - What would happen first?  
   - Where might the plan fail?  
   - Which decisions are critical?  
4. Capture the insights on one sheet or digital board.

## Outcome
Teams develop an intuitive sense of how scenarios play out,
highlighting weak points and opportunities for improvement.
