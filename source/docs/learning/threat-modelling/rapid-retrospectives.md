# Rapid retrospectives

Capture lessons immediately and turn experience into improvement.

## Why rapid retrospectives matter
Learning decays quickly if not captured.
Short reflection sessions reinforce insights,
build team awareness, and create actionable takeaways.

## Exercise instructions
1. After each exercise, gather the team for 15–20 minutes.  
2. Discuss:  
   - What went well? What did we learn about adversaries or scenarios?  
   - Which decisions were effective or problematic? Puzzles? 
   - Identify 1–2 immediate actions for improvement.  
3. Record the key points clearly and concisely.

## Outcome
Teams internalise lessons rapidly and create a culture of continuous improvement.
