# Hands-on exercises

Practical activities that make security concepts tangible through doing rather than hearing.

## Exercise: Password cracking demonstration (20 minutes)

Materials: Laptop, password cracking tool (Hashcat or John the Ripper), list of common passwords

Activity:
- Show hash of weak password
- Run cracking tool live
- Time how fast common passwords crack
- Compare weak vs. strong password times

Impact: Seeing "password123" crack in 2 seconds while random 16-character password still running after 10 minutes makes strength concrete.

Follow-up: Show password manager generating strong passwords, demonstrate autofill convenience.

## Exercise: Phishing link inspection workshop (15 minutes)

Materials: Examples of phishing links (don't click!), smartphone and computer

Activities:
1. Hover over links to reveal true destination
2. Examine URL structure for red flags
