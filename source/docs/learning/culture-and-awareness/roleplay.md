# Roleplay & social engineering games

Theatre-style exercises where people experience manipulation first-hand. Acting out scenarios makes abstract 
concepts concrete and builds recognition skills.

## Game: Social engineering speed dating (30 minutes)

Setup: Pairs rotate every 3 minutes. One person is attacker, one is target.

Scenarios provided on cards:
- "Convince them to let you into secure area without badge"
- "Get their password for 'security audit'"
- "Persuade them to click link in suspicious email"
- "Obtain sensitive company information through casual conversation"

Rules:
- Attacker uses any psychological tactic
- Target tries to resist without being rude
- After 3 minutes, discuss what worked and why
- Rotate: target becomes attacker, move to new partner

Debrief: Which tactics were most effective? How did it feel to be manipulated? What red flags should we remember?

## Game: "Yes, and..." security edition (20 minutes)

Improv theatre game adapted for security awareness.

Rules:
- Person starts security scenario
- Next person says "Yes, and..." and makes it worse
- Continue around circle making increasingly bad security decisions
- See how absurd it can get

Example chain:
- Person 1: "I received an email from my bank asking to verify my account"
- Person 2: "Yes, and I clicked the link even though the sender was actually bank.security-verify.ru"
- Person 3: "Yes, and I entered my username, password, and social security number"
- Person 4: "Yes, and I also entered my mother's maiden name and first pet's name"
- Person 5: "Yes, and when it asked for my full card details, I sent a photo of my card front and back"

Learning: Escalation of mistakes, how one bad decision leads to worse ones, absurdity makes it memorable.

## Game: Red flag spotting competition (15 minutes)

Materials: Print scenarios or display on screen.

- Email messages (legitimate and phishing mixed)

- 1 point for each legitimate red flag identified
