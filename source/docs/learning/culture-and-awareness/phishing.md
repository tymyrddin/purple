# Phishing simulations

Realistic but safe phishing campaigns that teach recognition and reporting. Done well, they build skills. Done poorly, they breed resentment.

## Doing phishing simulations right

Educational, not punitive: Goal is learning, not catching people out. No shame, punishment, or league tables of clickers.

Progressive difficulty: Start obviously fake, gradually increase sophistication as recognition improves.

Immediate feedback: When someone clicks, instant educational message. Don't wait weeks for training assignment.

Positive reinforcement: Celebrate reporting, not just avoid clicking. Reporting suspicious emails is desired behaviour.

Role-appropriate: Target with scenarios relevant to job. Finance gets invoice fraud, HR gets resume malware, IT gets urgent password requests.

## Simulation levels

### Level 1: Training wheels (First campaign)

Characteristics:
- Obviously suspicious
- Generic greeting
- Poor grammar
- External sender address clear
- Urgent but implausible request

Example:
```
From: security@company-email-verify.net
Subject: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED!!!
Dear User,
Your email account will be deleted in 24 hours unless you verify
immediately by clicking here.
Thank You,
Security Team
```

Learning objective: Basic red flag recognition. Build confidence.

### Level 2: Intermediate (Month 2-3)

Characteristics:
- More convincing sender
- Plausible scenario
- Better grammar
- Legitimate-looking branding
- Relevant to organisation

Example:
```
From: IT Support <itsupport@company.com> [actually from company-services.net]
Subject: Password Expiration Notice
Hi [Name],
Your password will expire in 3 days. Please update it here to avoid
account lockout.
IT Support Team
```

Learning objective: Closer inspection of sender, hover over links, verify urgency claims.

### Level 3: Advanced (Month 6+)

Characteristics:
- Spoofed from internal sender
- Timely/contextual (relates to actual company events)
- Sophisticated social engineering
- No obvious red flags

Example:
```
From: CEO Name <ceo@company.com>
Subject: Re: Board Meeting Prep
[Name],
Can you send me our latest financials? Board meeting moved up and I'm
travelling without my laptop.
Thanks,
[CEO Name]
```

Learning objective: Verify requests through alternative channels, question unusual requests even from authority.

## Response framework

### When someone clicks

Immediate feedback:
- "This was a training email"
- Explain red flags they missed
- Provide 2-minute video/article
- Encourage reporting actual suspicious emails
- No shame or punishment

### When someone reports

Immediate reinforcement:
- "Great job! This was a test."
- Praise for catching it
- Small reward (coffee voucher, public recognition)
- Feedback on what red flags they spotted

### Overall campaign results

Share organisation-wide:
- Click rate (without names)
- Reporting rate (celebrate increase)
- Most commonly missed red flags
- Resources for improvement
- Announcement of next simulation

Never:
- Name individuals who clicked
- Public shaming
- Tied to performance reviews
- Mandatory remedial training as punishment

## Measuring success

Click rate trending down: From 30% to 15% to 5% over year

Reporting rate trending up: From 5% to 20% to 40% reporting suspicious emails

Time to report decreasing: From days to hours to minutes

Real phishing caught: Staff reporting actual attacks before IT notices
