# Multi-vector attack (live injection, advanced)

* Target audience: Mature SIRT and SOC teams  
* Duration: Full day (6-8 hours)  
* Complexity: Very High  
* Format: Chained scenario with multiple parallel threads

## Overview

This advanced simulation runs multiple attack vectors simultaneously, forcing teams to prioritise, coordinate, and manage complex incident response under sustained pressure.

## Attack vectors (running in parallel)

Vector 1: Phishing campaign
- Staff receive realistic phishing emails
- Some click through (actors on simulation team)
- Credentials potentially compromised
- Need response and user communication

Vector 2: DDoS attack
- Services degraded
- Customer impact immediate
- Requires network operations response

Vector 3: Suspicious internal activity
- Possible insider threat or compromised account
- Requires investigation without disrupting operations

Vector 4: Vulnerability exploitation attempt
- Automated scanning detected
- Exploitation attempts on known vulnerability
- Patch management urgency

Vector 5: Data leak allegation
- Anonymous report of data on dark web
- Requires investigation and verification
- Potential regulatory implications

## Team challenges

Resource constraints:
- Not enough people to handle everything
- Must prioritise and delegate
- Some issues escalate if ignored

Communication chaos:
- Multiple channels active simultaneously
- Information overload
- Conflicting priorities from stakeholders

Decision fatigue:
- Rapid successive decisions required
- Incomplete information
- Trade-offs between speed and thoroughness

External pressure:
- Simulated media inquiries
- Executive demands for updates
- Customer complaints
- Regulatory body requests

## Facilitator team

Requires multiple facilitators:
- Red team coordinator (orchestrates attacks)
- Business stakeholder actors
- Media/external actors
- Observer/timekeeper
- Technical inject coordinator

## Phases (2 hours each)

Phase 1: Initial chaos
All vectors activate within 30 minutes. Teams struggle to triage and organise response.

Phase 2: Sustained pressure
New complications injected. Some vectors escalate, others seem to resolve. Fatigue sets in.

Phase 3: Crisis peak
Multiple vectors culminate. Major decisions required. Public attention intensifies.

Phase 4: Recovery begins
Attacks taper off. Focus shifts to recovery, communication, and learning. Documentation catch-up.

## Success criteria

Not about "winning" but about:
- Effective prioritisation under pressure
- Clear communication despite chaos
- Appropriate escalation and delegation
- Evidence preservation during crisis
- Maintaining operational security
- Team resilience and adaptation

## Debrief (2 hours)

Immediate hot wash (30 minutes):
- How do you feel?
- What was hardest?
- What surprised you?

Structured retrospective (60 minutes):
- Timeline reconstruction
- Decision analysis
- Communication review
- Coordination assessment

Improvement planning (30 minutes):
- Priority fixes
- Playbook updates
- Training needs
- Tool gaps
