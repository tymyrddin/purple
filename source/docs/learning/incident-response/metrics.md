# Measurement and metrics

## Capture during simulation

- Time to detection
- Time to containment decision
- Time to implementation
- Number of escalations
- Communication touchpoints
- Decision quality (assessed post-exercise)

## Assess after simulation

Response effectiveness:
- Correct prioritisation?
- Appropriate containment?
- Effective coordination?
- Clear communication?

Process maturity:
- Playbooks followed?
- Roles understood?
- Escalation working?
- Tools adequate?

Team resilience:
- Maintained effectiveness under pressure?
- Adapted to new information?
- Supported each other?
- Recovered from mistakes?

## Improvement tracking

After each simulation:
1. List 3-5 priority improvements
2. Assign owners and due dates
3. Track completion
4. Validate in next exercise

Measure progress over time:
- Response times improving?
- Fewer coordination gaps?
- Better decision quality?
- Increased confidence?
