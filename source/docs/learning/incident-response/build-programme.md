# Building your simulation programme

These simulations turn theoretical knowledge into practised capability. Start with what fits your team's current state, 
iterate based on learning, and build towards the complexity your threats demand.

## Start small

1. Single 90-minute tabletop
2. Team retrospective
3. Implement improvements
4. Repeat quarterly

## Scale gradually

1. Add complexity to scenarios
2. Extend duration
3. Introduce live injects
4. Involve more teams

## Mature over time

1. Regular cadence (quarterly minimum)
2. Rotate scenarios and complexity
3. Measure improvement
4. Build simulation library
5. Train internal facilitators

## Long-term benefits

Operational:
- Faster incident response
- Better coordination
- Clearer procedures
- Reduced errors

Cultural:
- Learning mindset
- Psychological safety
- Cross-team trust
- Resilience habits

Compliance:
- Evidence for audits
- Demonstrated preparedness
- Tested procedures
- Documented improvements
