# Facilitator guidance

## Preparation checklist

Logistics:
- Book appropriate space
- Ensure communication tools work
- Prepare scenario materials
- Brief observers and actors
- Test technical injects

Participant prep:
- Send pre-read materials
- Confirm roles
- Set expectations
- Ensure availability

Safety:
- Define stop words
- Establish boundaries
- Prepare de-escalation plan
- Have support available

## During simulation

Facilitator stance:
- Observe without interfering
- Inject at planned times
- Adapt to team pace
- Document key moments
- Watch for overwhelm

When to pause:
- Safety concern emerges
- Learning moment needs emphasis
- Team completely stuck
- Technical failure occurs

## Effective injects

Good injects:
- Reveal dependencies
- Create realistic dilemmas
- Test escalation paths
- Surface communication gaps
- Challenge assumptions

Bad injects:
- Purely technical puzzles
- "Gotcha" moments
- Unrealistic complications
- Punishing good decisions
- Overwhelming the team

## Debrief facilitation

Create psychological safety:
- No blame
- Learning focus
- Appreciate honesty
- Normalise difficulty

Draw out insights:
- What surprised you?
- Where did you hesitate?
- What would you do differently?
- What worked well?

Capture actionable improvements:
- Specific, not vague
- Owned by someone
- Time-bound
- Measurable
