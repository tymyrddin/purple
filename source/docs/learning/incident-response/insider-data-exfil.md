# Insider data exfiltration (tabletop)

* Target audience: SIRT, SOC, HR, Legal  
* Duration: 90 minutes  
* Complexity: Medium-High  
* Format: Tabletop with ethical/legal complications

## Scenario briefing

Thursday, 14:30 GMT

SOC detects unusual activity: employee account downloaded 15GB of customer data to personal cloud storage. 
Investigation shows systematic collection over past 3 weeks. Employee works in Customer Success, has legitimate 
access to customer records. Employee submitted resignation 1 month ago, final day is Friday (tomorrow).

Employee is currently in office.

## Key challenges

- Balancing investigation with employee rights
- Coordinating with HR and Legal
- Evidence preservation vs. business operations
- Potential regulatory breach notification
- Time pressure (employee leaves tomorrow)

## Decision points

Immediate response:
- Do we confront the employee now or continue monitoring?
- Do we disable their account immediately?
- Do we confiscate their laptop?
- What legal authority do we have?

Investigation:
- How do we preserve evidence without alerting employee?
- What can we legally investigate?
- Do we need law enforcement involvement?
- What about personal devices on corporate network?

Containment:
- Do we revoke access now or wait until end of day?
- How do we prevent further exfiltration?
- What about data already taken?
- Do we contact the cloud storage provider?

Communication:
- What do we tell the employee?
- What do we tell affected customers?
- What are our regulatory obligations?
- How do we protect employee rights while investigating?

## Facilitator injects

- "HR reports employee posted on LinkedIn about 'exciting new opportunity' at competitor"
- "Legal says any premature action could create wrongful termination liability"
- "Employee's manager says this person has been acting strangely and may have shared login with colleague"
- "Customer data protection impact assessment shows this incident triggers GDPR breach notification"
- "Employee requests to leave early today for 'medical appointment'"

## Special considerations

This scenario specifically tests:
- Cross-team coordination (SIRT, HR, Legal)
- Balancing urgency with due process
- Ethical decision-making under pressure
- Understanding legal constraints on investigation
- Sensitive communication management
