# Private programs

Most [bug bounty platforms](platforms.md) distinguish between public and private programs.

* Public programs are those that are open to all; anyone can hack and submit bugs to these programs, as long as they abide by the laws and the bug bounty programâ€™s policies.
* Private programs are open to only invited hackers. To get in, start in the public programs and score for reputation.
