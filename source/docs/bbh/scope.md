# Scope, payouts, and response times

On each bug bounty program’s page, metrics are often listed to help you assess the program. These metrics give insight into how easily you might be able to find bugs, how much you might get paid, and how well the program operates.

## Program scope

A program’s scope on its policy pages specifies what and how you are allowed to hack. There are two types of scopes: asset and vulnerability. The asset scope tells you which subdomain, products, and applications you can hack. And the vulnerability scope specifies which vulnerabilities the company will accept as valid bugs.

## Payout amounts

There are two types of payment programs: vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) and bug bounty programs. 

* VDPs are reputation-only programs, meaning they do not pay for findings but often offer rewards such as reputation points and swag. They are a great way to learn about hacking if making money is not your primary objective. Since they don’t pay, they’re less competitive, and so easier to find bugs in. You can use them to practice finding common vulnerabilities and communicating with security engineers.
* Bug bounty programs offer varying amounts of monetary rewards for your findings. In general, the more severe the vulnerability, the more the report will pay. But different programs have different payout averages for each level of severity. You can find a program’s payout information on its bug bounty pages, usually listed in a section called the "payout table".

## Response time

Some companies will handle and resolve reports within a few days, while others take weeks or even months to finalize their fixes. Possible causes of long response times:

* Security team internal constraints, like a lack of personnel to handle reports, a delay in issuing security patches, and a lack of funds to timely reward researchers. 
* Researchers/hunters have sent bad reports without clear reproduction steps.
