# State of the bug bounty hunting industry

In 1995, Netscape launched the first-ever bug bounty program. The company encouraged users to report bugs found in its brand-new browser, the Netscape Navigator 2.0, introducing the idea of crowd-sourced security testing to the internet world. Mozilla launched the next corporate bug bounty program nine years later, in 2004, inviting users to identify bugs in the Firefox browser.

But it was not until the 2010s that offering bug bounties become a popular practice. That year, Google launched its program, and Facebook followed suit in 2011. These two programs kick-started the trend of using bug bounties to augment a corporationâ€™s in-house security infrastructure.

As bug bounties became a more well-known strategy, bug-bounty-as-a-service platforms emerged. These platforms help companies set up and operate their programs. For example, they provide a place for companies to host their programs, a way to process reward payments, and a centralized place to communicate with bug bounty hunters.

The two largest of these platforms, HackerOne and Bugcrowd, both launched in 2012. After that, a few more platforms, such as Synack, Cobalt, and Intigriti, came to the market. These platforms and managed bug bounty services allow even companies with limited resources to run a security program.

In 2019, The European Commission announced the EU-FOSSA 2 bug bounty initiative for popular open source projects, including Drupal, Apache Tomcat, VLC, 7-zip and KeePass. The project was co-facilitated by European bug bounty platform Intigriti and HackerOne and resulted in a total of 195 unique and valid vulnerabilities [pdf](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/custom-page/attachment/2020-06/EU-FOSSA%202%20-%20D3.1%20Bug%20Bounties%20Summary%20Final_0.pdf).
