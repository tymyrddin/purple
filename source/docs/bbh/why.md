# Why (not) a Bug Bounty platform?

## Why?

* Initial Triage is done by the bug bounty platform staff. Triaging is the process of compiling vulnerability reports, verifying them, and communicating with hackers.
* The level of metrics/reports depend on individual platforms. All major bug bounty platforms have a feature to get metrics/reports.
* Integrations wth issue tracking, notification systems and platforms (Jira, Slack etc). Depending. Not all platforms provide integrations out of the box.
* All major bug bounty platforms provide different levels of RBAC, like editor, administrator, read-only etc. The principle of least privilege.
* Because thousands of researchers are already on the bug bounty platforms looking for programs to find vulnerabilities in, you get access to these researchers. And noise.
* Most of the major platforms assign customers a success manager. They will help with scope adjustments, platform features, filtering of researchers, bounty pay-outs, etc.

## Why not?

* Bug bounty platforms are not cheap. It is a real possibility that you pay more to the platform than you pay to security researchers (which is your primary audience). 
* Noise. Not only the best, but also starters are on the platforms.

| No worries about the logistics of emailing security<br>teams, following up on reports, and providing<br>payment and tax info every time you<br>submit a vulnerability report.                                                  | Programs on platforms break the connection<br>between hackers and developers. With a direct<br>program, you can discuss the vulnerability<br>with a company’s security engineers. |
| They can step in to provide conflict resolution and<br>legal protection as a third party.                                                                                                                                      | If you submit a report to a non-platform program,<br>you have no recourse in the final bounty decision.                                                                           |
| You can’t always expect companies to pay up or<br>resolve reports in the current state of the industry.<br>The hacker-to-hacker feedback system that<br>platforms provide is helpful.                                          | You may get a T-shirt                                                                                                                                                             |
| Public programs on bug bounty platforms are often<br>crowded, because the platform gives them extra<br>exposure. Many privately hosted programs do not<br>get as much attention from hackers and are thus<br>less competitive. | And for the many companies that do not contract<br>with bug bounty platforms, you have no choice<br>but to go off platforms if you want<br>to participate in their programs.      |

Not either/or, both then.
