# Why (not) a Bug Bounty platform?

## Why?

* Initial Triage is done by the bug bounty platform staff. Triaging is the process of compiling vulnerability reports, verifying them, and communicating with hackers.
* The level of metrics/reports depend on individual platforms. All major bug bounty platforms have a feature to get metrics/reports.
* Integrations wth issue tracking, notification systems and platforms (Jira, Slack etc). Depending. Not all platforms provide integrations out of the box.
* All major bug bounty platforms provide different levels of RBAC, like editor, administrator, read-only etc. The principle of least privilege.
* Because thousands of researchers are already on the bug bounty platforms looking for programs to find vulnerabilities in, you get access to these researchers. And noise.
* Most of the major platforms assign customers a success manager. They will help with scope adjustments, platform features, filtering of researchers, bounty pay-outs, etc.

## Why not?

* Bug bounty platforms are not cheap. It is a real possibility that you pay more to the platform than you pay to security researchers (which is your primary audience). 
* Noise. Not only the best, but also starters are on the platforms.
