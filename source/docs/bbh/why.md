# Why (not) use a Bug Bounty platform?

## Pros and cons for companies

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                               | Cons                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Initial Triage is done by the bug bounty platform<br>staff. Triaging is the process of compiling vulnerability<br>reports, verifying them, and communicating<br>with hackers.      | Bug bounty platforms are not cheap. It is a<br>real possibility that you pay more to the<br>platform than you would pay to security<br>researchers (your primary audience). |
| The level of metrics/reports depend on individual<br>platforms. All major bug bounty platforms have a<br>feature to get metrics/reports.                                           | Noise. Not only the best, but also starters<br>are on the platforms.                                                                                                        |
| Integrations wth issue tracking, notification<br>systems and platforms (Jira, Slack etc). Depending.<br>Not all platforms provide integrations out of the box.                     |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| All major bug bounty platforms provide different<br>levels of RBAC, like editor, administrator, read-only<br>etcetera. The principle of least-privilege.                           |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Because thousands of researchers are already on<br>the bug bounty platforms looking for programs to find<br>vulnerabilities in, you get access to these researchers.<br>And noise. |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Most of the major platforms assign customers a<br>success manager. They will help with scope<br>adjustments, platform features, filtering of researchers,<br>bounty pay-outs, etc. |                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Pros and cons for hunters

| Transparency into a company’s process: disclosed<br>reports, metrics about the programs’ triage rates,<br>payout amounts, and response times.                                                                                  | Triagers, third-party employees often not familiar<br>with all the security details about a company's<br>product, may handle reports improperly<br>(a common complaint).          |
| No worries about the logistics of emailing security<br>teams, following up on reports, and providing<br>payment and tax info every time you<br>submit a vulnerability report.                                                  | Programs on platforms break the connection<br>between hackers and developers. With a direct<br>program, you can discuss the vulnerability<br>with a company’s security engineers. |
| They can step in to provide conflict resolution and<br>legal protection as a third party.                                                                                                                                      | If you submit a report to a non-platform program,<br>you have no recourse in the final bounty decision.                                                                           |
| You can’t always expect companies to pay up or<br>resolve reports in the current state of the industry.<br>The hacker-to-hacker feedback system that<br>platforms provide is helpful.                                          | You may get a T-shirt you already have.                                                                                                                                           |
| Public programs on bug bounty platforms are often<br>crowded, because the platform gives them extra<br>exposure. Many privately hosted programs do not<br>get as much attention from hackers and are thus<br>less competitive. | And for the many companies that do not contract<br>with bug bounty platforms, you have no choice<br>but to go off platforms if you want<br>to participate in their programs.      |

Not either/or, both then.
