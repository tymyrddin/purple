Cross-team training
===========================================

The lore-keepers â€” telling cautionary tales and sharing wisdom to guide both sides.

* Develop and deliver cross-team training (e.g., how Blue interprets telemetry; how Red builds payloads).
* Run purple-themed tabletop exercises or detection vs evasion games.
* Teach Red Teamers how their actions show up in logs, and teach Blue how attacker tooling really behaves.
