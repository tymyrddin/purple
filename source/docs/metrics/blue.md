# Measuring blue team effectiveness

## SOC

| Metric                             | Definition                                                                                                                            | Meaning                                                                                                            |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mean Time to <br>Detection (MTTD)  | Average time the SOC takes to <br>detect an incident.                                                                                 | How effective the SOC is at processing <br>important alerts and identifying real <br>incidents.                    |
| Mean Time to <br>Resolution (MTTR) | Average time that transpires <br>before the SOC takes action <br>and neutralizes the threat.                                          | How effective the SOC is at gathering <br>relevant data, coordinating a response, <br>and taking action.           |
| Total cases <br>per month          | Number of security incidents <br>detected and processed by <br>the SOC.                                                               | How busy the security environment is and <br>the scale of action the SOC is managing.                              |
| Types of <br>cases                 | Number of incidents by type: <br>web attack, attrition (brute force <br>and destruction), email, loss <br>or theft of equipment, etc. | The main types of activity managed <br>by the SOC, and where preventative <br>security measures should be focused. |
| Analyst <br>productivity           | Number of units processed per <br>analyst — alerts for Tier 1, <br>incidents for Tier 2, threats <br>discovered for Tier 3.           | How effective analysts are at covering <br>maximum possible alerts and threats.                                    |
| Case escalation <br>breakdown      | Number of events that enter <br>the SIEM, alerts reported, <br>suspected incidents, confirmed <br>incidents, escalated incidents.     | The effective capacity of the SOC at each <br>level and the workload expected for <br>different analyst groups.    |

## SIRT

| Metric                                 | Definition                                                                                                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detection <br>success                  | Number of alerts by dept, team, site.                                                                                          | How effective the detection solution is. <br>If the SOC is not the greatest <br>source of alerts you have a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Detection to <br>decision              | The time it takes for activity <br>to be detected and processed <br>through the system to determine <br>if action is required. | How effective analysts, detection tools, <br>SIEM, etc. are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Decision <br>speed                     | The time it takes to make a <br>decision: includes the time needed <br>to get all hands on deck.                               | Decisions are made on every alert and <br>are heavily influenced by the number of <br>alerts ahead in the queue and how much <br>additional research an analyst must conduct.                                                                                                                          |
| False positive <br>rates               | The percentage of alerts that <br>upon investigation are revealed <br>to not be valid threats.                                 | False positives can reduce a security team’s <br>confidence in its tools and draws attention<br>away from serious underlying problems.<br>False positive feedback loops are to be <br>included in the process, and the only thing <br>worse than a false positive is an overlooked <br>false negative. |
| Time to <br>mitigation/<br>containment | The time it takes to see a security <br>concern, identify the <br>impact, determine the course of <br>action and implement it. | These numbers can vary widely but over <br>time trends will appear, providing <br>useful insight about where you need to <br>invest for additional protection, <br>remediation and automation capabilities.                                                                                            |
