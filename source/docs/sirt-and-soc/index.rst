SIRT & SOC
============================================

A strong Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) (and Security Operations Centre (SOC)) are the backbone of
organisational resilience. We help you set up teams, roles, workflows, and integrate detection
and response processes. The result is an operationally ready organisation capable of handling incidents
while continuously improving its security posture.
