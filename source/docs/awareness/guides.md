# Human-readable guides

Just like in pentesting, reports have to be adapted for specific audiences, without "talking down".
The term "human-readable" implies information that is meaningful for people and that can be comprehended quickly. 

The very best guides are produced by and for the people in the organisation, after a hands-on exercise in a [workshop](workshops.md), or a [simulation](simulations.md).
