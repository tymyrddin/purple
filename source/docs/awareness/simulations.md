# Simulations

After having done some experiential training, up next is simulations set up for specific situations 
in specific contexts of the organisation. This can even go as far as simulated red teaming where a 
[red team](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/) and [blue team](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/) play out [imaginary attack and defense scenarios](https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-tabletop-exercise-packages) in discussions.
