# Introduction

## What?

Raise security awareness.

## Why?

People are still the weakest link. They click on links or open attachments in phishing emails, or share information 
with unauthorised persons either intentionally or unintentionally. Organisations often struggle with peoples' 
engagement in information security and privacy, resulting in people not being aware of the important role they play.

And different people play different roles, and participants have different preferences. This must be taken into account. 
One size does not fit all.
