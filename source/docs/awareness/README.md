# Introduction

## What?

Enable organisations to create truly mature security awareness programs. After a lack of resources, time, and support by leadership, people are still the weakest link. Raising security awareness requires that users:

* Know the most common vulnerabilities
* Recognise when being attacked
* Realise that one can be attacked at any time
* Have the ability to respond during a real incident
* Recognise the importance of cybersecurity
* Can participate in building resilience

## Why?

Organisations often struggle with peoples' engagement in information security and privacy, resulting in people not being aware of the important role they play.

## How?

* [Identify vulnerabilities](identify.md)
* [Human-readable guides](guides.md)
* [Fun experiential workshops](workshops.md)
* [Simulations](simulations.md)
