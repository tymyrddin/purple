# The shadow exercise

*Advanced, cross-functional purple engagement*

Scenario: [Golem Trust Computing Ltd.](https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/docs/org/) is suspected, correctly or not, of 
operating a shadow capability beyond its public mandate. The exercise explores how this affects threat models, 
insider risk, and organisational trust.

Focus:

* How unofficial capabilities reshape risk
* What happens when defence acquires a shadow side
* How red teams adapt when blue teams know more than they admit

Outcome: A deeply uncomfortable but clarifying conversation about power, visibility, and long-term resilience.
