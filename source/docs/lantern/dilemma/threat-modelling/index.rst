Critical infrastructure in Ankh-Morpork
=============================================================

This threat model describes how disruptions to digital and operational systems affect:

* essential services
* economic activity
* public trust
* political and regulatory pressure

The focus is not on *how* systems are attacked or fail, but on *what happens next* and *who feels it*.
