# The narrative and information dimension

In any crisis, the *story* of what is happening becomes a force in its own right.

## Official communication

How the Patrician's office, the Watch, and the Guilds communicate with the public. Clarity builds trust. Silence or evasion breeds suspicion. Contradictory statements from different authorities amplify confusion.

## Rumour and informal channels

The city runs on gossip. Street vendors, guild halls, and taverns are information networks as powerful as any official channel. Rumours can spread faster than facts, especially during a communications disruption.

## Narrative framing

The story of *why* the crisis happened matters as much as the crisis itself. Was it inevitable neglect? A sophisticated attack from a rival state? Greedy guilds cutting corners? The dominant narrative shapes public anger, political pressure, and the legitimacy of the response.

## Amplification effects

* Visibility: An incident in Nap Hill gets more attention than one in the Shades.
* Symbolism: An attack on the Brass Bridge is an attack on the city itself.
* Duration: The longer a crisis lasts, the more narratives multiply and harden.
