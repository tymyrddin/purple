# Infrastructure domains

Each domain represents a combination of physical assets, digital systems, outsourced services, and human processes.

## Energy supply

Includes:

* Power generation (including the experimental "Geomantic Resonator" in the University)
* Substations and switching nodes
* Distribution networks (both above and below ground)
* Smart meters and household connections

Energy underpins almost every other domain.

## Water and sanitation

Includes:

* Water treatment (the famous Ankh-Morpork Water Company)
* Pumping stations
* Distribution networks
* Wastewater handling and processing

Public tolerance for water disruption is extremely low.

## Communications

Includes:

* Internet access (via semaphore relays and clacks towers)
* Mobile networks (the new "Talking Drums" service)
* Emergency communications
* Coordination systems used by public services

Loss of communication amplifies every other incident.

## Transport and movement

Includes:

* Bridges (including the unreliable Brass Bridge)
* Traffic control (watchmen on point duty, experimental automated gates)
* Public transport coordination (horse-drawn omnibuses, canal barges)
* Logistics routes to the docks and the Sto Plains

Transport failures have visible, immediate impact on daily life and business.

## Public services

Includes:

* Lady Sybil Free Hospital and other care facilities
* City Watch and emergency services
* Municipal administration (the Patrician's Palace)
* Enforcement and safety services (the Guilds, the Watch)

Failures here are politically sensitive and hard to recover from reputationally.

## Commercial and industrial sites

Includes:

* Food production and storage (the slaughterhouse district, the cheese caves)
* Markets and retail (the Shambles, the Saturday Market)
* Finance and payments (the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork, the Guild of Merchants)
* Large employers (the dwarf bread factories)

Disruption here translates quickly into economic and political pressure.

## Residential areas

Includes:

* Homes and tenements
* Apartment buildings (especially in the more respectable parts of the city)
* Small businesses operating out of dwellings
* Local utility connections

Residential impact is where abstract failures become personal.
