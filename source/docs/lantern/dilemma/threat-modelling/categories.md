# Threat categories

Threats are grouped by effect, not by attacker sophistication.

## Degradation and neglect

Description: Systems degrade over time due to underinvestment, deferred maintenance, outdated dependencies, or organisational fatigue.

Typical disruptions:

* Partial service loss
* Unreliable performance
* Cascading minor failures

Key characteristic: Often invisible until combined with stress or crisis.

## Operational error and misconfiguration

Description: Well-intended changes cause unintended outages or instability.

Typical disruptions:

* Sudden service interruption
* Delayed recovery
* Confusion about responsibility

Key characteristic: Happens during upgrades, migrations, or emergency fixes.

## Supply chain and vendor failure

Description: External dependencies fail, withdraw support, or introduce breaking changes.

Typical disruptions:

* Loss of monitoring or control
* Dependency lock-in
* Delayed remediation options

Key characteristic: Limited local control, high contractual complexity.

## 3.4 Criminal interference

Description: Disruptions intended to extract money, data, or leverage.

Typical disruptions

* Service shutdowns
* Data unavailability
* Forced operational workarounds

Key characteristic: Timing often maximises pressure rather than damage.

## Ideological or activist disruption

Description: Targeted interference intended to make a public statement or force policy change.

Typical disruptions

* Symbolic outages
* Selective service denial
* Reputational embarrassment

Key characteristic: Visibility matters more than duration.

## Strategic or state-aligned interference

Description: Actions designed to test resilience, create uncertainty, or apply pressure without open confrontation.

Typical disruptions

* Ambiguous failures
* Repeated low-level incidents
* Difficult attribution

Key characteristic: Designed to exhaust trust and confidence over time.
