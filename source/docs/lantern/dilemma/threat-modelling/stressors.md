# Systemic stressors

The city is not a blank slate. These pre-existing conditions shape how disruptions unfold and who they hurt most.

## Austerity and underinvestment

The Patrician runs a famously tight budget. Maintenance is deferred, upgrades are delayed, and reserve capacity is minimal. Systems work until they suddenly don't.

Amplifies: Degradation and neglect, operational error (due to untrained staff or outdated procedures).

## Just-in-time logistics

Ankh-Morpork eats, and it eats *now*. Food arrives daily from the Sto Plains. Manufacturing relies on parts that arrive exactly when needed. There is almost no slack in the system.

Amplifies: Transport disruption, commercial disruption, supply chain failure.

## Vendor monoculture

Many critical systems rely on a single provider. A single firm manages most traffic control. A single clacks company carries most financial data. A single engineering guild maintains most pumping stations.

Amplifies: Supply chain and vendor failure, strategic interference (a single point of pressure).

## Social and spatial inequality

The city is starkly divided. The wealthy hills of Nap Hill have redundant connections and rapid response. The Shades, and other poorer districts, have ageing infrastructure and are last to be restored. This inequality is built into the very pipes and wires.

Amplifies: Unequal impact, residential disruption, loss of trust.

## Organisational fragmentation

Responsibility is split between the Patrician's office, the Guilds, the City Watch, and private companies. In a crisis, no one is sure who is in charge, and information moves slowly between silos.

Amplifies: Operational error, delayed recovery, confused communication.
