# Cross-cutting effects

Some effects amplify all threats:

* Duration matters more than cause
* Visibility matters more than technical severity
* Unequal impact accelerates loss of trust
* Repeated small failures feel worse than one large one
* The story of the crisis shapes its consequences as much as the crisis itself
