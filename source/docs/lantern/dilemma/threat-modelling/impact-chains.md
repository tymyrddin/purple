# Infrastructure → disruption → impact chains

This is where the model becomes operational. 

## Energy supply disruption

Disruption:

* Rolling outages
* Unstable supply
* Delayed restoration

Direct dependencies:

* Communications (pumps, repeaters fail)
* Water (pumping stops)
* Transport (traffic lights, trams stop)
* Public services (hospitals lose power)
* Commercial (refrigeration, manufacturing stop)
* Residential (heating, lighting lost)

Immediate impact:

* Households lose heating or power
* Businesses suspend operations
* Transport systems degrade

Secondary impact:

* Economic loss
* Public frustration
* Media attention

Decision pressure:

* Prioritise who gets power first
* Justify unequal impact
* Balance emergency spending against long-term stability

## Water and sanitation disruption

Disruption:

* Unsafe water
* Reduced pressure
* Wastewater backup

Direct dependencies:

* Energy (pumps fail)
* Communications (monitoring lost)
* Public services (hospitals at risk)
* Residential (households affected)

Immediate impact:

* Households affected directly
* Hospitals and care facilities at risk

Secondary impact:

* Public alarm
* Health authority involvement
* Rapid trust erosion

Decision pressure:

* Act fast regardless of cost
* Communicate clearly under uncertainty
* Accept visible disruption to prevent invisible harm

## Communications disruption

Disruption:

* Loss of internet or clacks coverage
* Degraded emergency coordination

Direct dependencies:

* Energy (towers lose power)
* Public services (coordination fails)
* Commercial (payments halt)
* Residential (citizens lose information)

Immediate impact:

* Services struggle to coordinate
* Citizens lose access to information

Secondary impact:

* Rumours spread
* Incidents feel larger than they are
* Leadership appears absent

Decision pressure:

* Restore communication before fixing root causes
* Manage narrative while facts are incomplete

## Transport disruption

Disruption

* Bridge closures
* Traffic control failure
* Public transport outages

Direct dependencies:

* Energy (traffic lights, trams stop)
* Communications (coordination lost)
* Commercial (logistics halt)
* Public services (emergency response delayed)

Immediate impact:

* Visible daily disruption
* Workforce mobility affected

Secondary impact:

* Economic slowdown
* Public irritation escalates quickly

Decision pressure:

* Accept safety risks or prolong disruption
* Prioritise commerce versus safety

## Public service disruption

Disruption:

* hospital system outages
* emergency response delays

Direct dependencies:

* Energy (life support fails)
* Communications (coordination lost)
* Transport (responders can't reach)
* Water (sanitation at risk)

Immediate impact:

* Direct risk to life and wellbeing

Secondary impact:

* regulatory scrutiny
* political accountability
* long-term reputational damage

Decision pressure:

* Spare no expense
* Accept political fallout for transparency failures

## Commercial disruption

Disruption:

* Payment failures
* Supply chain interruption
* Production downtime

Direct dependencies:

* Energy (machinery stops)
* Communications (payments, orders halt)
* Transport (goods can't move)
* Water (some industries affected)

Immediate impact:

* Financial losses
* Workforce impact

Secondary impact:

* Lobbying pressure
* Media framing as economic mismanagement

Decision pressure:

* Decide which sectors to protect
* Justify public support for private loss

## Residential disruption

Disruption:

* Combined utility failures
* Prolonged service degradation

Direct dependencies:

* All of the above

Immediate impact:

* Daily life affected
* Emotional response amplified

Secondary impact:

* Protests
* Loss of political legitimacy
* Crisis fatigue

Decision pressure:

* Restore dignity, not just service
* Address fairness and equity explicitly
