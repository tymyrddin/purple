# Recovery pathways

How the city chooses to recover shapes its future resilience and the public's trust.

## Technical restoration

Fixing the immediate problem. Restoring service to pre-incident levels. Fastest option, but may not address underlying causes.

## Resilience investment

Rebuilding to a higher standard. Adding redundancy, upgrading systems, training staff. Slower and more expensive, but reduces future risk. Politically difficult to justify unless the crisis was severe enough.

## Compensatory measures

Paying for the harm caused. Compensating businesses, waiving fees, providing alternative services (e.g., bottled water). Addresses short-term anger but does not fix the system.

## Accountability actions

Identifying who or what was responsible. Public inquiries, firings, contract cancellations, regulatory changes. Essential for restoring trust, but can be divisive and may be resisted by powerful interests.

## The recovery choice

Every crisis forces a choice between these pathways. The choices made determine not just whether services return, but whether the city emerges stronger, weaker, or more divided.
