# Catalogue of Ankh-Morpork building types

## Guild headquarters
*(e.g., Assassins' Guild, Thieves' Guild, Fools' Guild, Seamstresses' Guild)*
- Description: The primary engines of the economy and de facto government. Each is a powerful, semi-autonomous entity controlling its trade, providing training, and enforcing its own laws.
- Consumes: Energy (for lighting, heating vast halls), Water, Communications (clacks, messengers), Security (internal enforcers)
- Produces: Tax revenue (to the Patrician), Skilled labour, Social order (by regulating their trade), Business confidence (stability), Guild fees
- Sensitivity to disruption: Very High. A major guild failing creates a power vacuum and economic chaos.
- Trust decay rate: Rapid. Confidence in the city's stability evaporates if the Thieves' Guild can't guarantee "security" or the Fools' Guild stops controlling its members.
- Failure Modes:
    - Criminal Interference: Ransomware on the Assassins' client list; extortion of the Seamstresses.
    - Ideological Disruption: A guild protest that shuts down markets or a split within a guild leading to civil war (e.g., Thieves vs. Cutpurses).
    - Degradation & Neglect: Ageing training facilities lead to a drop in standards, causing "unlicensed" practitioners to emerge.
    - Strategic Interference: Subtle manipulation of guild politics to weaken the city's power structure.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fix the specific problem (e.g., catch the extortionists).
    - Resilience Investment: The Patrician might force a guild to modernise its charter or share power to prevent future strife.
    - Compensatory Measures: Allowing the guild to raise its fees to cover losses; granting a special charter.
    - Accountability Actions: The Patrician "requests" the resignation of the Guild Head; a show trial within the guild.
- Narrative Hooks: "Assassins' Guild goes on strike over pension dispute," "Rogue faction within Thieves' Guild destabilises insurance market," "Fools' Guild clown shortage leads to rise in amateur, unfunny street performers."

## Taverns & inns
*(e.g., The Mended Drum, Biers)*
- Description: The social and informational heart of the city. A place for deals, news, relaxation, and casual violence. Ranges from rowdy to utterly disreputable.
- Consumes: Energy (for lighting the sign and cellar), Water (for cleaning, diluting beer), Communications (gossip is the main product, but they rely on news arriving), Food & Beverage Supplies
- Produces: Tax revenue, Public morale, Social cohesion, Information (for patrons and spies), Business confidence (over a pint)
- Sensitivity to disruption: Medium (Biers) to High (The Drum). A popular pub failing is a local disaster. Biers' clientele might be more patient with disruptions, as they have plenty of time.
- Trust decay rate: Moderate. A "beer shortage" is noticed immediately. A pub shut down for health reasons leads to rapid local grumbling.
- Failure Modes:
    - Degradation & Neglect: Cellar floods (water), roof collapses (neglect), beer lines foul.
    - Operational Error: A new brewer misconfigures the vats, ruining a batch of the famous Morporkian stout.
    - Supply Chain Failure: The brewery (see example) fails; hop supply from the Sto Plains is interrupted.
    - Criminal Interference: Protection racket demands become unsustainable; the pub is used for a crime, leading to a Watch crackdown.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fix the cellar pump; find a new hop supplier.
    - Resilience Investment: The owner digs a deeper well; diversifies drinks menu to include more spirits/dwarf bread.
    - Compensatory Measures: The owner offers a "night on the house" when the beer is back; the brewery compensates the pub for lost trade.
    - Blame: The landlord blames the water company, the brewery, or the rival pub across the street.
- Narrative Hooks: "Mended Drum loses its licence after a riot," "Bloody Mary mix-up at Biers causes existential dread," "Rival pub opens on Filigree Street, offering 'quiet contemplation'."

## Civic amenities
*(e.g., The Dwarf Bread Museum, The Dysk theatre)*
- Description: Cultural and entertainment institutions. They are not critical for survival but are vital for the city's soul, identity, and tourist trade.
- Consumes: Energy, Water, Communications (marketing, ticket sales)
- Produces: Cultural asset (pride, identity), Tourist revenue, Soft power, Public morale
- Sensitivity to disruption: Low to Medium. A museum closure is sad, not a crisis. A theatre burning down is a major cultural event.
- Trust decay rate: Slow. People are annoyed but not angry. If the Dysk remains closed for a season, trust in the city's vibrancy wanes.
- Failure Modes:
    - Degradation & Neglect: The museum's roof leaks, damaging priceless dwarf bread.
    - Criminal Interference: Theft of a major artefact (e.g., the Scone of Stone from the museum).
    - Ideological Disruption: A group of puritanical dwarfs protest an "un-dwarfish" exhibit; a rival theatre company sabotages the Dysk's premiere.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fix the roof; catch the thief.
    - Resilience Investment: Improve museum security; insure the artefacts.
    - Compensatory Measures: The Patrician donates a personal artefact to fill the empty spot; the theatre offers refunds.
    - Blame: The museum curator blames the City Watch for not preventing the theft.
- Narrative Hooks: "Scone of Stone stolen from museum! Dwarfish diaspora in uproar," "The Dysk's latest play, 'The Patrician: A Comedy,' sparks diplomatic incident."

## Slum dwellings
*(e.g., The Shades, Cockbill Street)*
- Description: High-density, low-quality housing. The population is resilient but has no margin for error. Pride and community are the main currencies.
- Consumes: Energy (if they can afford it), Water (from communal pumps), little else
- Produces: Labour pool, Local trust (strong community bonds), Crime (as an economic alternative), "Pride" (a non-material output)
- Sensitivity to disruption: Extreme. Any disruption is a direct threat to survival.
- Trust decay rate: Variable. Trust in neighbours might increase in a crisis, but trust in the authorities decays instantly.
- Failure Modes:
    - Combined Utility Outages: A pump fails, and there's no money to fix it. This is a daily emergency.
    - Criminal Interference: Gangs become more predatory when the legitimate economy fails.
    - Strategic/State-aligned Interference: Neglect by the authorities is the baseline state. Any disruption is blamed on them.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fixing the pump is the only thing that matters. Quickly.
    - Compensatory Measures: The Patrician might order a cart of water delivered, which buys a few hours of goodwill. Food drops.
    - Accountability Actions: Vimes personally visits and beats someone (metaphorically or literally) for the neglect. This is the only thing that restores faith.
    - *Resilience Investment is a foreign concept here, but would mean better housing.*
- Narrative Hooks: "Cockbill Street pump runs dry; residents refuse to complain out of pride," "Shades community organises own night watch after Watch pulled out," "Rumour of plague in the Shades leads to city-wide panic and quarantine."

## Middle-class and artisan housing
*(e.g., residences in the Isle of Gods or near Pseudopolis Yard)*
- Description: Respectable homes for merchants, guild members, and senior watchmen. They have a stake in the city's stability.
- Consumes: Energy, Water, Communications, Transport (to get to work)
- Produces: Tax revenue, Social stability, Local businesses (corner shops, bakeries)
- Sensitivity to disruption: High. These citizens are vocal and have the ear of the guilds.
- Trust decay rate: Moderate to Fast. They expect services for their taxes. A few days without water, and they're writing stiff letters to the Patrician.
- Failure Modes:
    - Combined Utility Outages: A power outage means no light for the shop, spoiled food, and a very annoyed merchant class.
    - Transport Failure: If the main bridge to their district is closed, they can't get to work or market.
    - Public Service Failure: A delayed Watch response to a burglary leads to a rapid loss of confidence.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fix the bridge. Restore power.
    - Compensatory Measures: A temporary tax break for affected businesses.
    - Accountability Actions: The head of the relevant guild demands an explanation from a city official.
- Narrative Hooks: "Isle of Gods residents demand action over river smell," "Merchants on Cockbill Street border petition for a new Watch patrol to protect their businesses from 'those people'."

## Major civic institutions
*(e.g., Pseudopolis Yard (Watch HQ), Post Office, Royal Mint)*
- Description: The newly empowered arms of the state. They represent the Patrician's reclamation of power and are symbols of modern, "civilised" Ankh-Morpork.
- Consumes: Energy, Water, Communications (heavy users), Transport (paddy wagons, postal coaches), Staff (trained personnel)
- Produces: Public order (Watch), Trust in government, Economic enablers (Postal service, currency), Symbolic legitimacy
- Sensitivity to disruption: Catastrophic. A failure here is a direct failure of Lord Vetinari's new model of governance.
- Trust decay rate: Instantaneous. The narrative is set by the opposition (e.g., Lord Rust) immediately: "See? The state can't run a mint, why trust it with anything?"
- Failure Modes:
    - Operational Error: A mis-sorted bag at the Post Office delays all correspondence for a day; the Mint accidentally mints coins with the wrong face.
    - Criminal Interference: A ransomware attack on the Watch's personnel files; a heist at the Mint.
    - Degradation & Neglect: The foundations of Pseudopolis Yard, a formerly disused building, prove unsound.
    - Public Service Failure: A Watch patrol is delayed, and a prominent citizen dies. The political fallout is immense.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: Fix the problem immediately, whatever the cost.
    - Accountability Actions: Moist von Lipwig must personally apologise and fix the mess. Commander Vimes must be seen to be in control. A scapegoat is found.
    - Resilience Investment: After the crisis, a new, more secure system is funded (e.g., a new clacks tower just for the Watch).
- Narrative Hooks: "Post Office glitch loses an aristocrat's invitation; he takes it out on a servant," "Pseudopolis Yard's new cell block collapses, freeing dozens of petty criminals," "Mint produces 'Vetinari' coin with unfortunate typo."

## The Palace / Patrician's seat
- Description: The political heart. Not just a residence, but the centre of administration, intelligence, and absolute, if veiled, power.
- Consumes: Energy, Water, Communications (the most secure clacks link), Security (elite guards), Information (from every corner of the city)
- Produces: Governance, Laws, Strategic direction, Stability, The ultimate guarantee of the guild system
- Sensitivity to disruption: Apocalyptic. An attack on the Palace is an attack on the idea of Ankh-Morpork itself.
- Trust decay rate: Immediate and terminal. If the Palace is compromised, the entire social contract collapses into civil war or coup.
- Failure Modes:
    - Strategic/State-aligned Interference: An assassination attempt (a constant, managed threat).
    - Ideological Disruption: A coordinated uprising by multiple guilds, effectively a siege of the Palace.
    - Degradation & Neglect: Unthinkable. Vetinari would never allow it.
- Available Remedies:
    - Accountability Actions: This *is* the remedy. The Patrician will find out who failed and make an unforgettable example of them.
    - Technical Restoration: Repelling the attack, securing the perimeter.
    - Resilience Investment: The Palace's security is already in a state of constant, paranoid investment. Any failure leads to another, deeper layer of security.
- Narrative Hooks: "A sewer tunnel collapses beneath the Palace, revealing a previously unknown route into the heart of power," "Vetinari is 'indisposed' for a week; the city holds its breath and functions perfectly, which terrifies everyone," "A new, polite, and reasonable political party requests an audience."

## Unseen University (UU)
- Description: The magical and oldest core of the city. A city-state within a city-state, governed by its own arcane laws. Its relationship with the Patrician is one of careful, mutual non-interference.
- Consumes: Energy (vast amounts for magical research), Water, Communications (wizards love gossip), Rare & Arcane Supplies (dragon's blood, etc.), Food (in vast, high-quality quantities)
- Produces: Magical knowledge, High-status graduates, Occasional world-saving (or world-endangering) events, A major source of employment (servants, groundskeepers), A massive consumer economy for the city's merchants
- Sensitivity to disruption: Low, from the University's perspective. They are self-sufficient and powerful. From the *city's* perspective, it's very high, as UU is a major economic engine and a source of unpredictable danger.
- Trust decay rate: Paradoxical. The city doesn't *trust* UU; it tolerates it. A disruption is met with fear ("What have they done now?") rather than a loss of faith.
- Failure Modes:
    - Operational Error: A student's thaumic experiment goes wrong, causing a localised reality fluctuation (e.g., it rains frogs on the Isle of Gods).
    - Degradation & Neglect: The Tower of Art, the oldest structure, begins to shed masonry, threatening the surrounding streets.
    - Ideological Disruption: An internal power struggle between faculty chairs spills out into the city, with wizards hexing each other across the rooftops.
- Available Remedies:
    - Technical Restoration: The Archchancellor orders the Senior Wrangler to "un-make it so." It may or may not work.
    - Accountability Actions: The Bursar is sent to apologise to the Patrician, who will extract maximum political capital from the event. The offending wizard is sent on a long, unpleasant research trip.
    - Compensatory Measures: UU pays for all damages, promptly and without argument (using ancient gold they have in abundance).
- Narrative Hooks: "The Tower of Art is leaning," "Wizard experiment causes all the beer in the Mended Drum to taste faintly of sulphur," "UU requests the city council fund a new library wing, citing 'rising book costs'."
