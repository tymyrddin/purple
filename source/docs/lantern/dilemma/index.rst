The Patrician’s dilemma
===============================

`Unseen University Power & Light Co. <https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/power/>`_ faces increasing pressure
from `Department of Silent Stability <https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/docs/shadows/>`_  to *see more*
`in the name of stability <https://indigo.tymyrddin.dev/docs/vetinari/>`_. Competing interests emerge between
security, civil trust, and political accountability.

And so, the Purple Lantern is making another simulator, this time where the question isn't, *how do we stop the attack?*,
but, *when the lights go out, who pays the price?*

Outcome: Leave with a shared understanding of boundaries, trade-offs, and the risks of silent overreach.

Do NOT focus on:

* Where does defensive monitoring become intelligence gathering?
* How legitimacy is preserved, or quietly eroded?
* Who decides what is acceptable when no option is clean?
