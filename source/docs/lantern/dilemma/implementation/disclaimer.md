This simulation is a model, not reality.

It represents complex social, economic, and technical systems in a simplified form so that decisions, trade-offs, and consequences can be explored safely and visibly. Like all models, it is incomplete by design.

## What this simulation *can* do

* Provide a structured mirror for decision-making under pressure
* Show how digital and operational risk translates into business, societal, and political impact
* Surface trade-offs between cost, downtime, public trust, and long-term resilience
* Expose second-order and cascading effects that are easy to overlook in isolation
* Support discussion between technical, executive, and governing roles using a shared reference point

TL;DR: it helps make consequences tangible.

## What this simulation *cannot* do

* Predict real-world events, timelines, or outcomes
* Replace professional judgement, domain expertise, or legal obligations
* Capture all political, cultural, human, or organisational dynamics
* Provide definitive answers or “correct” decisions
* Substitute for due diligence, independent advice, or democratic accountability

Outcomes in the simulation are illustrative, not prescriptive.

## TL;DR

- This simulation is best used as a thinking tool, not a decision engine.
- What matters is not “winning” the game, but the strategy adopted, assumptions made and undone, priorities revealed under constraint, and the questions that emerge as a result.
- Value lies in reflection, discussion, and comparison, before real people, services, and livelihoods are affected.
- Reality is messier than any simulation. That does not make simulation useless, it makes it honest.
- A space to explore, to test instincts, and to see yourself reflected back in the consequences of your choices.
