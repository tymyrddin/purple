# The Patrician’s dilemma

*(Government and civic analogue)*

Scenario: [Unseen University Power & Light Co.](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/power/) faces increasing pressure 
from [Department of Silent Stability](https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/docs/shadows/)  to “see more” 
[in the name of stability](https://indigo.tymyrddin.dev/docs/vetinari/). Defensive measures begin to resemble 
surveillance. Competing interests emerge between security, civil trust, and political accountability.

Focus:

* Where defensive monitoring becomes intelligence gathering
* How legitimacy is preserved, or quietly eroded
* Who decides what is acceptable when no option is clean

Outcome: Leave with a shared understanding of boundaries, trade-offs, and the risks of silent overreach.

Stability can be defended without being explained. Trust cannot.
