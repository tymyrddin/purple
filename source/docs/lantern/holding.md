# Holding the lantern

*For organisations approaching a first serious security audit*

Scenario: A plausible adversary, [The Scarlet Semaphore](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/scarlet/) exploits a series 
of minor weaknesses that individually look harmless. Defensive teams from the 
[Department of Silent Stability](https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/docs/shadows/) respond according to existing procedures.

Focus:

* How red insights translate (or fail to translate) into defensive action
* Where audit artefacts diverge from operational reality
* What evidence can be demonstrated under scrutiny

Outcome: A clear, honest path towards audit readiness, including what must change and what cannot be faked.
