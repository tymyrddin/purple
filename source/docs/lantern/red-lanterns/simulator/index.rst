Red Lantern simulator
===============================

This project develops methods, playbooks, and training that teach analysts to recognise when the city is being
rewritten rather than attacked, and to do so before stability becomes a historical footnote. We have also been tasked
to build a simulator to train people. Effective aim is to become prepared without doing damage to the city. Affective
aim of this training to cultivate a professional unease in the face of quiet correctness, because in Ankh Morpork,
that is usually where the trouble starts.
