# Simulator scenario 1: Registry reconnaissance and initial ROA creation 

## High‑level objective

Before attempting any prefix hijack, understand and establish legitimacy in the RPKI system. That means:

1.  Discover existing RPKI ROAs  for the target prefix
2.  Create a legitimate ROA for a prefix you control 
3.  Document the baseline  so defenders (and your SIEM) see this as “normal” activity

Why this matters:

* Later stages exploit weaknesses in RPKI validation
* But without first establishing legitimacy, later hijacks look suspicious
* So playbook 1 is about *laying the groundwork* without triggering alerts or suspicion
  This is a *control‑plane attack strategy* — not merely announcing forged prefixes, but shaping the validation infrastructure that tells routers what is “valid.” ([purple.tymyrddin.dev][1])

Key narrative:

*“RPKI ROAs are meant to be the truth that routers check announcements against. If we can manipulate ROAs, we redefine 
what ‘valid’ means.”*

This is different from a normal BGP hijack. It is a control‑plane preparation that makes later hijacks look valid.

## Turning playbook 1 into a simulator scenario

Control-plane attack preparation showing:

- RPKI infrastructure reconnaissance (Action 1.1)
- Legitimate ROA creation and publication (Action 1.2)
- Baseline documentation (Action 1.3)

The [scenario.yaml and telemetry.py](https://github.com/ninabarzh/red-lantern-sim/tree/main/simulator/scenarios/easy/playbook1) 
code is based on the *essence* of [Playbook 1](../playbooks/1.md), boiled down to what matters for the simulator.

These map to the *three phase‑1 actions* described in the playbook. The telemetry.py mapping script decides *what 
telemetry to emit* for each type of event in `scenario.yaml` and mirrors *Phase 1 actions* without making anything 
malicious.
