From attack trees to red team playbooks
=========================================

Attack trees are lovely things. They sit there on whiteboards looking impressively complete, with their neat branches
and their satisfying logical AND/OR gates. They make management feel like security is being taken seriously. They
make consultants feel like they've delivered value.

They are also completely useless for actually *doing* anything.

This is not a criticism. Attack trees were never meant to be operational documents. They're maps, not recipes. They
show you the territory; they don't tell you how to walk through it whilst carrying forty kilos of kit and hoping
nobody notices.

Red team playbooks are what happen when you take an attack tree seriously enough to ask "what would this actually
look like if someone tried it?"
