*Illuminating the space between attack and defence*

Purple Lantern Practice Ltd designs and facilitates purple-team engagements that help organisations understand
how security actually behaves under pressure.

We work between `red insight <https://red.tymyrddin.dev/>`_ and `blue responsibility <https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/>`_,
turning adversarial thinking into shared understanding, and shared understanding into credible readiness for audits,
incidents, and difficult decisions.

We do not run your systems. We do not sell tools.

Disclaimer
----------

These engagements are designed to be simulations on paper, yet close enough to reality to make participants uneasy
for all the right reasons.
