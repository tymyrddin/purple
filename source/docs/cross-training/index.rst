Cross-training & capability building
===========================================

Cross-training builds versatile, resilient teams capable of responding to a wide range of challenges. Through
practical exercises, gamified projects, and rotation programmes, your staff gain hands-on experience in both
offensive and defensive operations. This strengthens individual skills while fostering collaboration and
organisational agility.
