# Responsible disclosure programme

## What a responsible disclosure programme is

A responsible disclosure programme is the formal way an organisation receives, handles, and fixes reports of security 
vulnerabilities and security breaches. It exists to make sure problems are reported safely, handled consistently, 
and resolved before harm spreads.

This is not about marketing or looking good. It is about survival.

## Why it matters

Without a programme, reports fall through the cracks. Engineers guess priorities. Legal teams panic. Attackers get time.

A working programme turns chaos into process. It protects users, infrastructure, and credibility. It also reduces the 
financial impact when things go wrong, which is usually measured in Euros, not pride.

## Scope of the programme

The programme covers:

* Technical vulnerabilities
* Configuration weaknesses
* Supply chain exposures
* Data exposure and privacy failures
* Confirmed and suspected security breaches

It applies to production, staging, test environments, internal tooling, and third party services where risk is shared.

## Roles and responsibilities

A responsible disclosure programme only works when ownership is clear.

Typical roles include:

* Security triage team
* Incident response team
* Engineering leads
* Legal and compliance advisors
* Communications and stakeholder leads
* Executive sponsor

Every report must have a named owner. Shared responsibility usually means ignored responsibility.

## Intake channels

Reports must have clear and predictable entry points.

Typical channels include:

* A dedicated security email address
* A secure web form
* Encrypted messaging where appropriate
* Telephone for time critical incidents

All channels must be monitored, logged, and tested regularly.

## How reports are handled

Every report, whether about a vulnerability or a breach, follows a controlled process.

In practice:

* Acknowledge the report
* Record it in a secure tracking system
* Perform initial severity assessment
* Attempt safe reproduction
* Assign technical ownership
* Decide containment actions
* Begin remediation work

Nothing is dismissed without explanation.

## Handling active breaches

Breaches are handled differently from simple vulnerabilities.

When a breach is suspected:

* Priority shifts to containment
* Logs are preserved
* Systems are isolated where needed
* External access is restricted
* Internal escalation is immediate

Concealment makes situations worse. Delay multiplies damage.

## Communication principles

Silence damages trust. Chaos damages trust faster.

The programme defines:

* How reporters are updated
* When internal teams are informed
* When executives are briefed
* When regulators must be notified
* When users must be informed

Transparency is controlled and intentional, not reactionary.

## Legal safe harbour

A responsible programme must be defensible in law.

The programme includes:

* Safe harbour commitments for good faith reporters
* Clear behavioural boundaries
* Prohibition of extortion or coercion
* Alignment with contract and criminal law

This protects both the organisation and the reporter.

## Rewards and recognition

When security research is done properly, it deserves recognition.

The programme can include:

* Financial rewards in Euros
* Public acknowledgement where appropriate
* Private letters of thanks
* Priority hiring consideration

Rewards are based on impact and professionalism, not noise.

## Metrics and continuous improvement

A programme that does not measure itself will decay.

Typical metrics include:

* Time to acknowledgement
* Time to triage
* Time to containment
* Time to remediation
* Reoccurrence rates
* Cost of incidents in Euros

These metrics are reviewed regularly and used to improve the process.

## Integration with security operations

The programme is part of daily security operations, not a side project.

It feeds directly into:

* Threat intelligence
* Incident response workflows
* Risk management
* Architecture decisions
* Training and awareness

Disclosure is a sensor, not an afterthought.

## Abuse of the programme

This programme is not a bargaining chip.

Reports involving:

* Extortion
* Threats of publication for payment
* Destructive testing
* Bad faith activity

Will be treated as hostile actions and escalated accordingly.

## TL;DR

A responsible disclosure programme is a contract with reality.

You accept that you will be wrong sometimes. You accept that others will find your mistakes. You build a system 
that lets you fix them before adversaries use them first.
