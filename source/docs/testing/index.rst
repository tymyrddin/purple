Testing and validation
===============================

* Run controlled attack scenarios to validate detection, logging, and response (e.g., Atomic Red Team, MITRE ATT&CK emulation).
* Maintain and run adversary emulation plans tailored to the actual threat model.
* Help Blue identify gaps in coverage or tuning needs.
