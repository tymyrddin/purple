# Who?

Pentesters can be contractors or internal employees who regularly test their employerâ€™s network with insider knowledge.
Traditional pentests often provide a small number of testers on site for two weeks once a year. For some compliance
testing, it is **required** to use external testers. Pentesters must respect the legal contracts theyâ€™ve signed with
clients or employers, and they must work within the scope defined in the contract.
