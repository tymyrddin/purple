  :alt: Bird’s-eye cutaway of a resilient factory fortress showing all layers: assets, networks, sensors, redundant systems, personnel executing recovery plans, logs and continuity plans pinned on walls, attack scenarios represented visually.

OT systems are mission-critical. Any downtime can disrupt production, safety, and revenue. ISO 22301 ensures
structured continuity and disaster recovery processes are in place.

These pages are not tutorials. They are for executives, managers, and OT professionals who have already deployed
systems, and now need to verify coverage, spot gaps, and prepare for an audit.
