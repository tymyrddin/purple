# Potential storms and saboteurs

ISO 22301 – disruptions / adversaries (Clause 8.2 & 8.3)

Disruptions are not always malicious, but they affect operations the same way. Think of them as storms or incidents 
that could stop the factory if unprepared. Understanding them allows targeted continuity measures.

## Key disruption categories

1. Technical outages

   * PLC, SCADA, server, or sensor failure.
   * Check: Are redundancies and failover systems in place? Are maintenance records current?

2. Environmental incidents

   * Power loss, fire, flooding, HVAC failure, or extreme temperatures.
   * Check: Are backup power, environmental monitoring, and emergency procedures documented and tested?

3. Human factors

   * Operator error, procedural mistakes, staff absence, or miscommunication.
   * Check: Are procedures documented and understood? Is cross-training in place?

4. Supply chain interruptions

   * Delays in spares, maintenance services, or vendor support.
   * Check: Are critical suppliers identified? Are alternative vendors and contingency stock planned?

5. Cyber incidents

   * Malware, ransomware, misconfiguration, or protocol abuse affecting OT systems.
   * Check: Are IT/OT continuity plans aligned? Are recovery procedures defined for cyber disruptions?

## Executive gap‑spotting

* Does every plausible disruption have a mapped recovery procedure?
* Are critical dependencies addressed to prevent cascading failures?
* Are responsibilities for response, communication, and decision-making clearly assigned?
* Are lessons from past disruptions captured and applied to improve resilience?
