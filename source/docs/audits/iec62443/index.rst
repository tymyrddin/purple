  :alt: A steampunk factory fortress under attack, dark ghostly figures slipping through side gates, saboteurs tampering with pipes and control panels, exposed cables and weakly guarded access points, steam and smoke obscuring movement, clockwork systems strained.

A practical lens on IEC62443, the industrial control systems security standard. Not tutorials: they assume that the
work is done, devices deployed, networks segmented, and processes running. Their purpose is to help spot gaps, shore
up defences, and verify that every control is documented and auditable.
