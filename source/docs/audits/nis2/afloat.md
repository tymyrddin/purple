# Staying afloat

![Raft](/_static/images/staying-afloat.png)

The river keeps flowing. Threats evolve, regulations update, and your organisation changes. NIS2 compliance is not a destination you reach and forget; it is an ongoing operational state requiring sustained attention and adaptation.

## Monitor continuously for effectiveness

Security operations need constant vigilance. Monitor critical systems around the clock if service criticality demands it. Run regular vulnerability scans to find weaknesses before attackers do. Integrate threat intelligence to understand current attack patterns. Analyse security events to separate signals from noise. Track metrics and KPIs to see whether controls are working as intended.

Control effectiveness requires regular testing. Test controls on defined schedules to verify they still function. Conduct internal audits reviewing documentation and practice. Run penetration testing at least annually to simulate realistic attacks. Execute tabletop exercises walking through incident scenarios. Consider red team assessments for mature programmes that want a realistic challenge.

Performance tracking shows what is working. Measure the mean time to detect incidents to understand how quickly problems are spotted. Track mean time to respond to see how fast incidents are contained and remediated. Monitor vulnerability remediation times from discovery to fix. Measure patch compliance rates across your environment. Track security awareness test results to verify training effectiveness. Analyse incident trends to identify improvements. Identify gaps where risks are not adequately addressed.

## Maintain an annual governance cycle

Board-level reviews keep security visible. Conduct an annual review of the security programme, its strategy, and effectiveness. Update risk assessments as threats and business operations change. Allocate budget and resources based on current needs. Review strategic security initiatives and their progress. Report compliance status honestly with supporting evidence. Refresh management training on evolving obligations.

Policy and procedure updates prevent drift. Review policies annually for relevance and accuracy. Validate procedures against current practice to catch divergence. Update templates to reflect lessons learned. Integrate lessons from incidents into documentation. Incorporate regulatory changes as they occur.

Training and awareness never stop. Deploy annual mandatory training for all staff on current threats. Provide role-specific refreshers for specialised functions. Integrate security into new employee onboarding from day one. Brief management regularly on emerging security issues. Raise awareness of emerging threats as they appear.

## Adapt to organisational change

Changes in the organisation affect security. New systems or services introduce new risks. Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures change scope and structure. New suppliers or vendors alter supply chain risk. Workforce changes affect knowledge and capability. Business model evolution may change what is critical.

Technology changes create new challenges. Cloud migrations shift responsibility boundaries. Digital transformation initiatives expand the attack surface. New technologies such as AI, IoT, and OT introduce unfamiliar risks. Decommissioning legacy systems changes infrastructure. Tool upgrades or replacements require relearning and reconfiguration.

The threat landscape evolves constantly. Emerging attack techniques require new defences. New vulnerability classes affect different systems. Sector-specific threats target your industry. Geopolitical developments change threat actor motivations and capabilities. Ransomware trends shift tactics, requiring response adaptation.

## Track regulatory evolution

Monitor changes to understand obligations. Follow updates to NIS2 implementation across member states. Watch for new guidance from supervisory authorities clarifying expectations. Note sector-specific requirements as they emerge. Track related regulations such as GDPR, DORA, and CER that interact with NIS2. Follow EU cybersecurity strategy developments shaping the future direction.

Participate in sector forums for shared learning. Join information sharing and analysis centres for your sector. Engage with sector-specific working groups. Participate in supervisory authority consultations where available. Join industry associations addressing common challenges. Network with peers facing similar compliance issues.

## Improve continuously from experience

Learn from everything that happens. Conduct post-incident reviews after every significant event. Address audit findings systematically rather than ignoring them. Capture lessons from exercises and act on them. Analyse operational challenges to identify root causes. Study near-miss incidents that could have been worse.

Benchmark and mature your programme. Compare practices against sector peers to identify gaps. Adopt security framework maturity models to measure progress. Progress from reactive response towards proactive prevention. Build predictive capabilities to identify problems before they manifest. Develop a security culture where everyone feels responsible.

Innovation and optimisation make security sustainable. Automate repetitive tasks to free staff for higher-level work. Improve control efficiency to reduce overhead. Reduce false positives that cause alert fatigue. Streamline processes to remove unnecessary friction. Leverage new technologies to make security easier rather than harder.

## Maintain audit readiness always

Keep evidence current and organised to respond quickly to requests. Maintain documentation hygiene by removing outdated materials. Conduct regular internal assessments to catch problems early. Run mock supervisory interactions to practice. Establish quick-response procedures for authority requests.

Sustain commitment from leadership and across the organisation. Maintain executive sponsorship with active involvement. Ensure adequate resourcing as needs evolve. Clarify accountability so everyone knows their role. Recognise and reward security contributions. Build a security champions programme to spread expertise across the organisation.

## Output

The output of this stage is annual compliance reviews showing continued adherence, updated risk assessments reflecting current reality, continuous monitoring reports demonstrating vigilance, improvement roadmaps showing evolution rather than stagnation, and board reporting packages keeping leadership informed and engaged.
