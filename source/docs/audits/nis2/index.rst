NIS2 compliance is navigable for organisations of any size that fall within scope. It requires systematic preparation,
cross-functional coordination, and realistic planning, but it is not insurmountable. Thousands of essential and
important entities across the EU are successfully making the crossing.

   :caption: Unlike climbing a mountain where the path is largely yours to choose, crossing a river means respecting the current. NIS2 has more prescriptive requirements, mandatory incident reporting timelines, and specific obligations you cannot simply route around. The current flows in one direction, and you must navigate it successfully.
