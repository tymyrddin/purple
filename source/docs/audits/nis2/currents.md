# Into the current

![Currents](/_static/images/currents.png)

Now you enter the water. This phase puts everything you have prepared into action and demonstrates that it works under real conditions, not just in documentation.

## Phase your launch intelligently

Months 1-3: establish core capabilities - Activate critical technical controls to protect your most important assets. Operationalise incident detection so you can identify when something goes wrong. Begin security monitoring with logging and alerting. Start the awareness training programme across all staff. Establish regular governance meetings so leadership remains informed and engaged.

Months 4-6: complete full implementation - Deploy remaining technical measures mapped during planning. Activate business continuity capabilities with tested procedures. Roll out supply chain security processes to assess and monitor vendors. Implement vulnerability management with scanning and remediation tracking. Establish formal incident reporting procedures with templates and contact lists ready for use.

Months 7-9: focus on testing and validation - Conduct tabletop exercises walking through incident scenarios without putting actual systems at risk. Test incident response procedures under simulated conditions. Validate backup and recovery by actually restoring from backups. Run security awareness assessments to verify training effectiveness. Review and refine processes based on lessons learned.

Months 10-12: optimise and prepare - Address findings from testing, as every exercise reveals gaps. Refine procedures based on operational experience and feedback from users. Prepare compliance evidence organised for potential supervisory review. Conduct an internal audit of your implementation. Ensure readiness for supervisory authority interactions by having clear answers and organised documentation.

## Make security business-as-usual

Integrate security into existing workflows rather than treating it as a separate activity. People resist bolt-on processes but accept those that are integrated. Automate tasks where possible, such as monitoring, alerting, patching, and reporting, so focus remains on decision-making rather than repetitive work. Establish regular review cycles, monthly or quarterly depending on the process under review. Create metrics and dashboards for board reporting that show trends rather than snapshots. Incorporate security into projects and change processes from the start rather than adding it at the end.

Common challenges appear in every organisation. Resistance arises because people are comfortable with existing ways of working. Alert fatigue may result from monitoring tools producing too many false positives. Competing priorities and resource constraints occur when security needs conflict with delivery pressure. Integration issues can arise between tools that do not communicate. Process bottlenecks occur where necessary approvals slow progress.

Address these challenges through clear communication of regulatory obligations. Help staff understand the reasoning behind changes. Provide practical training and support rather than relying solely on documentation. Roll out changes gradually with feedback loops to allow adjustments based on real experience. Ensure executive sponsorship and accountability to make it clear that security is not optional. Conduct regular process reviews and improvements, recognising that no process is perfect on first implementation.

## Output

An operational security programme running daily, tested procedures that staff actually follow, performance metrics 
showing what works and what does not, and documented lessons learned for continuous improvement.
