# Stress-testing resilience under pressure

It is easy to assume your continuity plans will work because they look good on paper. Reality has a nasty habit of 
tearing those plans apart at the seams.  

This workshop is about *trying to break things on purpose* — in a safe environment. By stress-testing your 
organisation against realistic scenarios, you discover whether your defences, processes, and people can stand up 
under actual pressure. Better to learn in a room with coffee than in the middle of a crisis.  

## Core principles

* Safe-to-fail environment: Experiments are designed to surface gaps, not shame individuals.  
* Realism over theatre: We use scenarios drawn from your actual context, not generic “hurricane hits HQ” clichés.  
* Adaptive, not scripted: Facilitators adjust the pressure based on your team’s responses.  
* Actionable outcomes: The point is not just to watch things break, but to identify how to strengthen them.  

## How it works: A practical structure

This workshop can run as a focused tabletop (2–3 hours) or as a full-day live simulation.

1. Setup: Choose your stress test  
   * Ransomware outbreak during payroll.  
   * Key supplier failure mid-project.  
   * Sudden regulatory audit.  
   * Senior leadership unavailable at a critical decision point.  

2. Immersion: Run the scenario  
   * Teams work through the event as it unfolds.  
   * Facilitators inject new complications to simulate cascading failures.  
   * Observers note bottlenecks, confusion points, and ad-hoc problem solving.  

3. Debrief: Harvest the insights  
   * What worked surprisingly well?  
   * Where did we stall or stumble?  
   * Which dependencies proved most fragile?  

4. Output: Action plan under fire  
   * A distilled set of lessons, captured in plain language.  
   * Prioritised fixes that can be implemented before the next real incident.  

## Who it is for

This workshop is designed for teams who cannot afford to discover weaknesses during the real thing. We adapt the format for:  

* Executive crisis response groups.  
* IT & security operations centres.  
* Cross-functional project teams with high dependencies.  
* Organisations preparing for audits, certifications, or public scrutiny.
