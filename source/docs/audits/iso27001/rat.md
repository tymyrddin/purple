# Risk assessment table

This table is designed as a practical reference for assessing vulnerabilities, threats, and risks in your organisation. It is not a checklist where you simply tick boxes — it is a conversation starter to identify what could go wrong, why, and how to mitigate it.

Each row connects what can go wrong (vulnerability), how it might happen (threats), what kind of threat it is (deliberate, accidental, environmental), which ISO 27001 control it maps to, and how you can reduce the risk (mitigating controls).

**Threat types**: D = Deliberate, A = Accidental, E = Environmental
