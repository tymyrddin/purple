## Comprehensive notes

These docs are my expedition notebook. Rough, practical, and written for use, not display. They collect what I needed to 
remember while navigating ISO 27001: the paths taken, the shortcuts avoided, and the occasional cliff edge. They are not 
a polished guide, but they map the territory well enough for another climber to find their way.

The notes were made for me, so they are dense, incomplete in places, and occasionally cryptic. Still, if you are making 
a similar ascent, you may find them useful, not as instructions, but as a record of where footing was firm and 
where scree shifted underfoot or crevasses hid:
