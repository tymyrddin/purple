Before starting the climb, let’s take a moment at base camp. The ISO 27001 summit may look daunting — steep slopes 
of policies, hidden crevasses of risks, and the occasional paperwork avalanche — but with a clear route, the right 
gear, and a bit of humour, we can navigate the path step by step. This presentation is a map, compass, and 
introductory guide to reaching the top.
