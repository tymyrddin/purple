# Seeing the cracks before they spread

Most audits are paperwork theatre. Boxes get ticked, reports gather dust, and everyone pretends risks are “managed.”  
Meanwhile, attackers, accidents, and reality itself could not care less.  

This workshop flips the script. Instead of focusing on compliance, we make risks visible in practical,  
human terms so your team can actually act on them. It is about surfacing weak points before they break — and  
building resilience that survives first contact with the unexpected.

## Core principles

* Evidence over paperwork: No checklists for their own sake. Every finding is tied to observable practices, processes, or assets.  
* Cross-functional, not siloed: Risks are rarely contained to IT, finance, or HR alone. We bring multiple voices into the same room.  
* Transparent, not performative: The goal is clarity, not “scoring well.” Problems are surfaced to be solved, not hidden.  
* Resilience, not just risk: We do not stop at identifying what can break; we explore how to bend without snapping.  

## How it works: A practical structure

The workshop is modular and adaptable, scalable from a focused half-day session to a multi-day deep dive.

1. Mapping what matters (The “What”)  
   * Identify your most critical assets: systems, processes, and relationships.  
   * Capture interdependencies that often get ignored (people, vendors, data flows).  

2. Running stress scenarios (The “So what”)  
   * Explore realistic “what-if” events: supply chain choke, ransomware outbreak, critical staff absence.  
   * Discuss cascading consequences and recovery pathways.  

3. Prioritising weak spots (The “Now what”)  
   * Evaluate single points of failure and fragile processes.  
   * Highlight opportunities for mitigation, redundancy, or monitoring.  

4. Output you can use  
   * A concise, visual “resilience map” showing risks, dependencies, and mitigations.  
   * Prioritised recommendations that help you act immediately rather than file reports.  

## Who it is for

This workshop is designed for organisations that want clarity rather than another 100-page PDF. We tailor the content for:  

* Executive & leadership teams (understand systemic risk without jargon).  
* IT & security teams (map technical risks in real-world context).  
* Operations, HR, and finance teams (surface overlooked dependencies).  
* Cross-functional task forces (get everyone talking the same language).
