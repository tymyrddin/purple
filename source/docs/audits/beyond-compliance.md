# Beyond compliance: building adaptive organisations

Regulatory checklists are useful only until the threat doing the breaking does something the checklist did not anticipate.  

Attackers do not read ISO standards; they exploit human shortcuts, business incentives, and brittle processes. This 
workshop helps organisations move from checkbox compliance to genuine resilience — the kind that survives surprises 
and adapts as the world changes.

## Core principles

* Adaptive, not static: Maturity is a direction of travel, not a certificate on a wall. We design changes that can evolve.  
* Contextual, not copy-paste: Controls must fit your organisation’s mission, technology, and culture — not the other way round.  
* Forward-looking, not rear-view: We prioritise risks you are likely to face next, not the ones you faced last year.  
* Inclusive, not siloed: Resilience requires operational, legal, HR, product and leadership voices in the same room.  
* Evidence-driven: Recommendations come from interviews, observations, and light red-team probing — not from theory alone.

## How it works: practical steps

This is a structured assessment and co-design process, scalable from a focused two-day review to a multi-week maturity programme.

1. Rapid maturity assessment (remote, 1–2 days)
   * Short survey and document review to establish the current baseline: policies, playbooks, incident history, and tooling.  
   * High-level scoring across people, process, technology, and partnerships to focus next steps.

2. Culture and capability interviews (onsite or remote, 2–4 days)
   * Role-based interviews with leadership, operational teams, security, HR, legal, and key vendors.  
   * Structured questions to reveal incentives, informal practices, knowledge gaps, and shadow dependencies.

3. Directed probing & light red team (1–3 days)
   * Non-destructive probing to test assumptions: phishing-lite, process walk-throughs, supplier failure scenarios, or a short red-team vignette.  
   * The goal is to surface real-world gaps quickly, not to run a full adversary emulation campaign.

4. Co-design workshop (1 day)
   * Cross-functional session to translate findings into practical interventions.  
   * Prioritise small, high-impact changes and define experiments to increase resilience rapidly.

5. Roadmap & playbook delivery
   * A pragmatic resilience roadmap with short-, medium-, and long-term actions.  
   * A lightweight playbook capturing updated roles, simple metrics, and the first-wave experiments to run.

## Typical outputs

* A one-page resilience maturity snapshot with clear priorities.  
* A six- to twelve-week roadmap of pragmatic, tested interventions.  
* Role-specific short playbooks (operations, security, exec comms).  
* A short after-action report from probing exercises with recommended, timebound fixes.

## Who this is for

* Organisations that want resilience as an operational capability, not a compliance checkbox.  
* Executive teams who need concise, decision-relevant insight into organisational fragility.  
* Heads of security, risk or operations who must align technical controls with human and business realities.  
* Product, legal, and HR leads who want to understand how their policies actually play out in practice.

## Formats & duration

* Health check (2–5 days): rapid maturity assessment + executive briefing.  
* Deep review (2–3 weeks): full interviews, probing, and roadmap.  
* Programme (3 months): iterative implementation support, coaching, and follow-up probing.

## Optional add-ons

* Targeted red-team engagements (full emulation) for high-risk environments.  
* Playbook authoring and documentation handover.  
* Follow-up coaching sessions to embed changes and measure improvement.

## Take the next step
