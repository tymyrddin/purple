# Rapid resilience review (for execs and boards)

Executives do not need another 100-page risk report gathering dust. They need clarity on what could take the 
organisation down, and whether the current response is enough. This session strips away jargon and 
exercises straight into what matters: top risks, resilience posture, and decisions at board level.

## Core principles

* Concise: Deliver insights that fit on a single page, not a binder.  
* Decision-relevant: Frame risks in terms of choices leaders must make, not abstract probabilities.  
* Action-oriented: End with concrete commitments and priorities, not vague awareness.  
* Contextual: Tie risks directly to the organisation’s strategy and sector, not generic frameworks.  
* Blame-free: Create space for honest discussion without defensiveness.

## How it works: streamlined and focused

This is not a consultancy marathon. It is a rapid, high-value intervention designed for time-poor leadership.

1. Pre-session prep (remote, 1–2 days)
   * Quick review of existing risk registers, continuity plans, and recent incidents.  
   * Short interviews with 2–3 senior stakeholders.  
   * Draft “top 5 risk candidates” list for discussion.

2. Leadership tabletop (onsite or remote, 2–3 hours)
   * Facilitated session with executives and board members.  
   * Walk through the top risks in scenario format: “What happens if this breaks tomorrow?”  
   * Map readiness gaps and decision points.  
   * Encourage candid debate about risk appetite and priorities.

3. Response alignment (onsite or remote, 1–2 hours)
   * Capture agreed actions and responsibilities.  
   * Clarify escalation paths and communication strategies.  
   * Align leadership on priorities for investment, policy, or organisational change.

4. Synthesis & delivery (remote, 1–2 days)
   * Produce an executive dashboard:  
     * Top 5 risks (clear, non-technical language).  
     * Current resilience posture (ready, partial, exposed).  
     * Key decisions needed (investment, staffing, strategy).  
   * Deliverable: a 2–3 page briefing, designed to be read and acted on in 10 minutes.

## Typical outputs

* A concise executive dashboard highlighting the organisation’s resilience gaps.  
* Agreed list of leadership-level decisions and commitments.  
* Shared language for ongoing board discussions about resilience.  
* Option to turn the session into a recurring quarterly or annual exercise.

## Who this is for

* Boards needing to understand systemic risks without drowning in detail.  
* Executive teams preparing for regulatory scrutiny or investor questions.  
* Leadership in fast-moving sectors where traditional risk reporting lags behind reality.  
* Any organisation where decisions about resilience compete with other strategic priorities.

## Formats & duration

* Rapid review: prep + 1 half-day exec session + 2-page dashboard.  
* Quarterly cadence: ongoing updates with evolving risk picture.  
* Deep dive (add-on): follow-up with targeted assessments or scenario planning.
