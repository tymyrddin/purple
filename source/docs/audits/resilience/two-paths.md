# Two paths across, NIS2 and ISO 27001

Organisations often ask whether to pursue NIS2 compliance on its own or combine it with ISO 27001 certification. 
The answer depends on your situation, but understanding how they differ can help decision-making.

## Key differences in a nutshell

| Aspect               | ISO 27001                                      | NIS2                                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nature               | Voluntary international standard for ISMS      | Mandatory EU legal requirement                                            |
| Applicability        | Any organisation globally                      | Essential and important entities in specific EU sectors                   |
| Scope                | Organisation chooses scope boundaries          | Scope determined by law based on sector and size                          |
| Flexibility          | Risk based control selection from Annex A      | Mandatory minimum measures required in Article 21                         |
| Certification        | Third party certification available            | No certification, compliance verified by supervisory authorities          |
| Incident reporting   | Internal processes, not mandated               | Strict mandatory timelines (24 hours, 72 hours, 1 month)                  |
| Penalties            | Loss of certification                          | Legal penalties up to €10M or 2 percent of global turnover                |
| Management liability | No personal liability                          | Personal liability possible for management bodies                         |
| Supply chain         | Addressed in controls but flexible             | Explicit mandatory requirements                                           |
| Governance           | Required but flexible structure                | Board level oversight explicitly mandated                                 |
| Audit frequency      | Annual surveillance and 3 year recertification | Ongoing supervisory oversight and inspections determined by the authority |

## Why organisations pursue both

Many do, and for good reasons. ISO 27001 provides a proven ISMS framework and methodology, international recognition 
and market credibility, a structured approach to risk management, third party validation of security programmes, 
competitive advantage in procurement, and improved customer confidence and trust.

NIS2 adds legal compliance for in scope entities, mandatory incident reporting, explicit supply chain requirements, 
supervisory oversight and enforcement, sector specific security coordination, and personal accountability for 
management.

The combined benefits matter. ISO 27001 implementation satisfies many NIS2 requirements. ISO 27001 certification helps 
demonstrate that you have taken appropriate measures. Shared documentation and evidence reduce duplication. A single 
ISMS framework covers both. Mature processes reduce the overall compliance burden.

## When dual compliance makes sense

Consider pursuing both if market expectations favour it. For example, international customers require ISO 27001 
certification, procurement processes reward certified suppliers, competitive advantage existing in the sector, or 
operating across multiple jurisdictions with differing requirements.

Organisational maturity also plays a role. Dual compliance suits organisations that want structured ISMS guidance, 
prefer independent validation, value continuous improvement, and have the resources to sustain both programmes.

Risk management benefits may tip the balance as well. Dual compliance supports defence in depth, external validation 
of controls, structured growth of a security programme, and clear demonstrations of due diligence beyond minimum 
requirements.

## When NIS2 alone suffices

NIS2 compliance alone may be enough if your requirements are narrow. For example, you operate only in EU sectors 
covered by NIS2, no customer expects ISO 27001 certification, budget constraints are real, or your focus is legal 
compliance rather than market positioning.

Your existing security programme may already be mature. If you already operate an effective ISMS without 
certification, and if your controls meet or exceed NIS2 requirements, you may prefer to focus on regulatory 
obligations rather than external audits.

Organisational priorities might differ as well. Resources may be better spent on improving security rather 
than managing certification overhead, the certification value may be unclear in your market, you may wish to avoid 
the audit burden, or you may plan to pursue certification later once compliance is well established.

## Integrate efficiently if you pursue both

Share foundations to avoid duplication. A single ISMS framework can serve both requirements. A common risk 
assessment can feed both programmes. A unified policy structure keeps things consistent. Combined documentation 
reduces unnecessary paperwork.

Take an incremental approach. First implement the mandatory NIS2 measures for legal compliance. Then expand towards 
full ISO 27001 Annex A coverage. Pursue ISO 27001 certification once your processes are stable and properly resourced. 
Maintain both through a unified set of processes going forward.

Map requirements to find overlaps. Article 21 of NIS2 aligns closely with ISO 27001 Annex A. Incident reporting is 
not part of ISO 27001. Supply chain requirements are similar but phrased more firmly in NIS2. Governance obligations 
overlap substantially. Use gap analysis to identify what is unique to each.
