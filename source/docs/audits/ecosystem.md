# Your organisation as an ecosystem

Risks do not sit obediently in silos. They travel through people, technology, suppliers, and regulators with the 
grace of a domino chain collapsing. Yet most audits pretend each domain can be managed in isolation. This workshop 
takes a systems view: mapping your organisation as an ecosystem where interdependencies matter more than individual 
parts.

## Core principles

* Systems view: Look at the organisation as a living network, not a set of departments and policies.  
* Interconnectedness: Dependencies between HR, IT, suppliers, and partners shape actual resilience.  
* Cascading failure awareness: The first failure rarely matters most — it is the second, third, or tenth knock-on effect that brings the house down.  
* Cross-boundary thinking: Security, risk, operations, product, and vendor management are different lenses on the same system.  
* Practical foresight: The goal is not to model every possible scenario but to highlight critical weak links and where they converge.

## How it works: practical steps

This is an applied mapping and analysis process, grounded in collaborative workshops and real-world scenarios.

1. Dependency discovery (remote prep, 1–2 days)
   * Collect existing org charts, process diagrams, vendor lists, and incident reports.  
     * Run a short survey to capture informal dependencies (e.g. “who do you call when X breaks?”).  
     * Map known critical suppliers and cloud services.

2. Ecosystem mapping workshop (onsite, 1–2 days)
   * Interactive mapping with stakeholders from across teams (tech, ops, HR, finance, product).  
   * Build a live dependency map that captures people, processes, tech platforms, and external partners.  
   * Highlight single points of failure and hidden connectors.

3. Scenario walkthroughs (onsite or remote, 1 day)
   * Walk through realistic “what if” scenarios: cloud outage, key supplier failure, insider absence, regulatory shock.  
     * Trace the ripple effects across the system map to see how problems cascade.  
     * Capture intervention points and resilience gaps.

4. Synthesis & roadmap (remote, 2–3 days)
   * Translate findings into a concise ecosystem risk profile.  
   * Produce resilience recommendations ranked by impact and feasibility.  
   * Develop a roadmap balancing quick fixes (e.g. backup vendor contracts) with long-term systemic changes (e.g. redesigning processes to reduce hidden dependencies).

## Typical outputs

* A visual system map of your organisation’s critical interdependencies.  
* Cascading impact analysis for 2–3 high-priority scenarios.  
* A set of resilience recommendations spanning people, tech, and supply chain.  
* A short executive summary that cuts across silos and presents system-level insights.

## Who this is for

* Organisations reliant on complex supply chains, cloud services, or distributed teams.  
* Leadership teams tired of siloed risk reports that miss the big picture.  
* Risk and security professionals looking to move beyond asset inventories toward system resilience.  
* Operational leaders who want to know where the next domino might fall.

## Formats & duration

* Baseline mapping (3–5 days): ecosystem map + top interdependencies.  
* Deep dive (2–3 weeks): workshops, scenarios, and resilience roadmap.  
* Strategic programme (3 months): ongoing mapping, monitoring, and leadership coaching.

## Optional add-ons

* Integration with existing BCM / ISO frameworks.  
* Visual dashboards for ongoing ecosystem monitoring.  
* Follow-up scenario exercises and red-team style stress tests.
