# Measuring SOC performance

Without measurable indicators, a SOC cannot improve. Lean metrics help track effectiveness, prioritise improvements, 
and justify investments without overwhelming the team with unnecessary data.

## Key metrics

* Mean Time to Detection (MTTD): Average time from initial event to detection.
* Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR): Average time to contain or remediate an incident.
* Analyst productivity: Alerts processed per analyst, response times, and workflow adherence.
* Case volumes and escalation breakdowns: Monitor recurring incident types, frequency, and whether alerts required escalation.

## Tips

* Keep the metric set small and focused on actionable insights.
* Use dashboards to make performance visible and immediate.
* Link metrics to improvement initiatives, not just reporting.

## Example use

Tracking MTTR over three months may reveal that certain alert types consistently take longer to resolve, highlighting gaps in workflow or analyst training.
