# SOC maturity and learning

A SOC that stops improving is a SOC at risk. Continuous feedback and iterative learning ensure that detection, response, and coordination get smarter over time.

## Key practices

* Post-incident reviews: Conduct reviews promptly after incidents, documenting successes, gaps, and decisions.
* Incorporate lessons learned: Update detection rules, workflows, and escalation paths based on findings.
* Purple-team exercises: Simulate attacks to test detection and response, identify blind spots, and refine SOC processes.
* Incremental maturity: Focus on small, continuous improvements rather than chasing perfect processes.

## Tips

* Foster a no-blame culture: focus on learning rather than punishment.
* Use metrics and review outcomes to prioritise the next improvements.
* Track progress annually or after major organisational or threat landscape changes.

## Example scenario

After a coordinated phishing simulation, the SOC updates alert thresholds, adjusts triage workflows, and retrains 
analysts on email patterns to improve response next time.
