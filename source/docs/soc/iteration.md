# Building and refining SOC workflows

SOC processes are living artefacts. Iterative development ensures that workflows, runbooks, and playbooks remain 
effective and relevant.

## Key actions

* Collaborative design: Involve SOC analysts, SIRT members, and business stakeholders when creating workflows.
* Regular updates: Update workflows after incidents, lessons learned, or exercise feedback.
* Scenario testing: Run tabletop exercises and simulations to validate workflows under pressure.
* Automation with oversight: Automate low-risk repetitive steps, but retain human judgement for complex decisions.

## Tips

* Use visual, step-by-step runbooks that are easy to follow under stress.
* Treat each update as a small, incremental improvement rather than a major rewrite.
* Encourage feedback from analysts—those on the front line see issues first.

## Example scenario

A workflow for ransomware alerts may include automatic log collection, alerting SIRT, isolating affected endpoints, and post-incident review. Each step is reviewed and refined quarterly.
