# SIRT roles: who does what?

Even small SIRTs benefit from clearly defined roles. Clear responsibilities reduce confusion during incidents and ensure critical actions are never missed.

## Essential roles

1. Incident lead:

   * Oversees the entire response process.
   * Makes strategic decisions and escalates to leadership when needed.
   * Keeps the team focused under pressure.

2. Technical lead:

   * Investigates technical aspects, from malware to system compromise.
   * Coordinates forensic evidence collection.
   * Works closely with monitoring and SOC teams if they exist.

3. Communications lead:

   * Manages internal messaging to staff and leadership.
   * Prepares external communications if necessary (customers, regulators, press).
   * Keeps messaging consistent, accurate, and timely.

4. Documentation lead:

   * Records all incident actions, timelines, and decisions.
   * Produces post-incident reports for learning and compliance purposes.

5. Business representatives:

   * Legal, HR, and management ensure operational decisions align with organisational priorities.
   * Provide context on business-critical systems and potential impact.

## Tips

* These are only examples. Your context may require more or fewer roles. Roles can be combined if the team is very small, but clarity is essential.
* While your active SIRT members may not be senior executives, it is wise to involve executives in recruitment and in organisation‑wide communications about the team.
* Avoid assigning responsibilities on the fly during an incident—it increases mistakes and delays.
* Use visual charts or simple tables to make roles and responsibilities immediately clear.
* A SIRT can also operate as part of a larger [security operations team](../soc/index.rst).
