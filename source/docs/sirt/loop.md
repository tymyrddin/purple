# Improving after each incident

Every incident is an opportunity to learn. Agile SIRTs [embed learning into daily practice, updating processes, 
playbooks, and skills frequently](../knowledge-transfer/index.rst).

## Important practices

* Post-incident reviews: Conduct reviews promptly, ideally within days, while details are fresh.
* Update workflows and playbooks: Incorporate lessons learned into checklists and runbooks.
* Track recurring issues: Identify systemic weaknesses to prioritise preventive actions.
* Share knowledge safely: Distribute lessons to internal teams while respecting confidentiality and legal constraints.

## Tips

* Keep feedback loops short: small, frequent improvements are more effective than infrequent major overhauls.
* Encourage a no-blame culture: focus on learning and resilience.
* Include [metrics](metrics.md) where useful: time to detection, resolution, and escalation help measure improvement over time.
