# Leveraging external support

No matter how lean, a SIRT benefits from external networks and expertise. These partnerships provide intelligence, 
additional capacity, and validation of your processes.

## Strategies

* Identify trusted CSIRTs and peers: Know who you can reach for guidance or support. Maintain current contact info.
* Agreements for assistance: Have informal or formal arrangements for sharing intelligence or requesting technical help during incidents.
* Optional support, not replacement: The SIRT remains responsible for decision-making; external partners supplement internal capability.
* Engage regulators appropriately: If required, establish reporting channels before incidents occur to avoid delays or confusion.

## Tips

* Treat external partners as emergency contacts: regularly confirm availability.
* Include partners in [occasional simulation exercises](../learning/incident-response/index.rst) to test coordination.
* Keep partnerships documented and easily accessible during incidents.

## CSIRT.global

[CSIRT.global](https://csirt.global/) is a volunteer‑led, non‑profit foundation registered in the Netherlands, with 
a mission to make the internet safer by finding and reporting vulnerabilities that others often overlook. It works 
internationally, in close cooperation with trusted CSIRTs, CERTs, infrastructure operators, and the wider security 
community.

What CSIRT.global does:

* Identifies and verifies vulnerabilities in systems, services, and devices.
* Notifies affected organisations and vendors, working to ensure vulnerabilities are fixed.
* Handles responsible disclosure, especially for large‑scale or internet‑wide issues.
* Shares findings with trusted partners to improve collective security.

Where it operates:

* Globally, with volunteer members and partner organisations across sectors and countries.

What it can do for your organisation:

* Assist in identifying vulnerabilities you may not have the resources to find yourself.
* Provide verified, responsibly disclosed reports to help you address issues quickly.
* Connect you to a trusted network of responders for coordinated remediation.

CSIRT.global is not an incident management contractor — they will not take over your breach investigation or run 
your SIRT — but they can be a valuable ally in the *prevention* side of security, especially for vulnerabilities 
that could otherwise go unnoticed.
