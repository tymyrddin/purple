# Organising before the storm

Preparation is the backbone of effective incident response. A well-structured SIRT knows who does what, who to contact, 
and how to escalate.

Key actions:

* Define authority: Make it clear who can make decisions, approve communications, and trigger escalation.
* Document escalation paths: Identify when to bring in leadership, external partners, or regulators. Include contacts, methods, and expected response times.
* Maintain current contact lists: Ensure all team members and external partners can be reached quickly, including backups.
* Develop simple checklists: Include recurring incident types such as malware infections, system outages, or data breaches. Keep them concise, actionable, and easy to follow.Detect, respond to, and learn from security incidents effectively:

Best practices:

* Use visual maps for escalation paths—flowcharts reduce confusion.
* Test your structure periodically with tabletop exercises.
* Keep all documents versioned but lightweight—don’t overcomplicate.
