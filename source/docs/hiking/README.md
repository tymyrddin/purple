# Introduction

## What?

Build skills for the wilderness by learning from the experts on safe trails (labs with realist scenarios), continue with bug bounty hunting, and make writeups to document all trails hiked. Then make your own trails.

## Why?

* Writeups showcase your progress and serve as cheatsheets and reminders for future engagements.
* They maybe even provide an easier entry level for others. 
* Communication with peers also feels nice and improves collaborating with others and other teams. 
* And what is neater than a well-written perfectly-structured pentesting topic? As if perfectly-structured is possible. Hacking is not easy to structure, because the process is more like a fusion dance. Fusion dancing may involve creating a new dance style, recreating an already established dance style, combining existing styles of movement and other possibilities we probably haven't thought of yet. 
* And improving communication is also a worthy goal.
