# Potential problems

## Common failure modes

* Over-complex Docker environments
* Inconsistent startup behaviour
* Reliance on timing or race conditions
* Incomplete or noisy PCAPs
* Multiple unintended solution paths

Tend to appear after submission, hardly ever before.

## Dependencies

| Dependency     | Notes                             |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------|
| Linux          | Tested on modern distributions    |
| Docker Engine  | Required for dynamic environments |
| Docker Compose | For orchestration where used      |
| Python         | For deterministic simulator       |
| Git, Make      | For setup                         |

Fewer runtime dependencies increase acceptance probability.
