Purple teaming
============================================

Purple Teaming bridges the gap between offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) operations. By sharing insights,
refining strategies, and coordinating exercises, it ensures that attacks inform defenses and defenses strengthen
against future attacks. This collaborative approach builds resilient, high-performing organisations capable of
adapting to evolving threats.
