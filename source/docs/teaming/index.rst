Colourful teaming
============================================

Red teaming done well reveals uncomfortable truths about security. Done ethically and collaboratively, those truths
drive meaningful improvements that make organisations more resilient against real adversaries.

Blue teaming isn't about building perfect defences. It's about being able to detect attacks quickly,
respond effectively, and improve continuously.

Purple teaming provides the feedback loop that makes blue teams stronger.
