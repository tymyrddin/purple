Purple teaming
============================================

Purple Teaming bridges the gap between offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) operations. By sharing insights,
refining strategies, and coordinating exercises, it ensures that attacks inform defenses and defenses strengthen
against future attacks. This collaborative approach builds resilient, high-performing organisations capable of
adapting to evolving threats.

Since the Red team is usually a somewhat messy fun of offensive operations, and the Blue is likely structured
around detection, defence, and incident response. For best results, the Purple team can own operational synergy:
turning lessons from attack and defence into better strategy, tooling, and training.
