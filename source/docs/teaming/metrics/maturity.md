# Maturity Model

## 5-stage threat detection & response maturity

| Level	          | Detection	                             | Response	                             | Offensive Testing                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 - Initial	    | Ad-hoc alerts, no ATT&CK mapping	      | Manual processes	                     | Annual penetration test           |
| 2 - Developing	 | Basic ATT&CK coverage (<50%)	          | Playbooks for critical TTPs	          | Quarterly Red Team exercises      |
| 3 - Defined	    | 70% ATT&CK coverage, automated alerts	 | SOC integrates threat intel	          | Monthly Purple Team collaboration |
| 4 - Measured	   | â‰¥90% coverage, MTTD <30min	            | Automated containment for known TTPs	 | Continuous emulation + feedback   |
| 5 - Optimizing	 | Predictive analytics (AI/ML)	          | Self-healing systems	                 | Red Team emulates advanced APTs   |
