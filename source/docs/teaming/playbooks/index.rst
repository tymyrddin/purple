Playbook development
===============================================

Wake up to a constantly changing environment, with new threats, tactics, and technologies, to new laws, regulations,
guidelines, frameworks, and standards.

The goal throughout all stages of a purple team operation is to improve the security posture of a system pretty
much immediately by running attacks and validating detections and alerts for the most imminent threats, currently
still systems, and hypervisors, IoT, and the cloud.

* Build shared playbooks, runbooks, and response workflows â€” not for IR alone, but for proactive threat hunting, detection engineering, and adversary emulation.
* Maintain a shared tactical intelligence database (IOC tracking, hypothesis-based hunting templates, etc.).
