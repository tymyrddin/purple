# Defining clear objectives

Every engagement needs specific, measurable objectives. "Test our security" isn't an objective. "Validate EDR detects credential dumping" is.

## Types of objectives

Detection validation: Test whether specific security controls detect particular attack techniques. "Does SIEM alert when privilege escalation occurs?"

Response validation: Test incident response procedures under realistic conditions. "Can we contain lateral movement within 30 minutes of detection?"

Coverage assessment: Map defensive capabilities against threat framework. "Which MITRE ATT&CK techniques can we detect?"

Tool effectiveness: Validate security technology investments work as expected. "Does new EDR solution catch malware our previous tool missed?"

Process improvement: Test coordination between teams, escalation procedures, communication workflows.

Training and skill building: Develop analyst capabilities through realistic scenarios.

## SMART objectives

Make objectives Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound:

- Vague: "Improve our security"
- SMART: "Validate that SOC analysts can detect and contain ransomware simulation within 1 hour, following documented playbook, by end of Q2"

## Success criteria

Define what success looks like before the engagement:
- Detection occurred within X minutes
- Alert triggered appropriate playbook
- Containment prevented lateral spread
- Communication followed procedure
- Evidence was preserved correctly
