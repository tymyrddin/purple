# Resource planning

Engagements require time, people, tools, and sometimes budget.

## Time allocation

Planning: 1-2 weeks for first engagement, faster for repeat exercises
Preparation: Red team reconnaissance and tool setup, blue team readiness checks
Execution: Hours to weeks depending on scenario complexity
Documentation: Real-time logging plus post-engagement reporting
Debrief: Half-day to full-day debrief session
Remediation: Weeks to months implementing improvements

## People requirements

Red team: 1-3 people depending on scope. Can be internal staff, contractors, or consultants.

Blue team: SOC analysts, incident responders, threat hunters depending on objectives. Usually existing staff.

Purple team facilitator: One person coordinating, documenting, and facilitating learning.

Observers: Optional additional security staff observing for training purposes.

Stakeholders: Leadership, IT operations, communications as needed for realistic scenario.

## Tools and infrastructure

Red team needs:
- Attack simulation tools (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, custom scripts)
- C2 infrastructure (can be cloud VPS or local)
- Testing frameworks (Atomic Red Team, Caldera)

Blue team needs:
- Functioning SIEM, EDR, and monitoring tools
- Incident response tools and forensics capabilities
- Communication platforms
- Documentation systems

Shared infrastructure:
- Safe testing environment if not using production
- Shared documentation and collaboration tools
- Logging and evidence collection systems

## Budget considerations

Internal resources: Staff time costs even if no external spend
External services: Consultants, testing tools, cloud infrastructure
Tool licensing: Some testing or monitoring tools require additional licenses
Training: Skill development for team members
Contingency: Buffer for unexpected needs or complications
