# Documentation requirements

Good documentation enables learning and provides evidence of testing.

## Pre-engagement

Engagement plan: Objectives, scope, ROE, timeline, participants, success criteria
Authorisation: Signed permission documents
Risk assessment: Potential impacts and mitigation plans
Communication plan: Who knows what and when

## During engagement

Red team documentation:
- Every command executed (timestamped)
- Tools used and configurations
- Systems accessed
- Data accessed or modified
- Obstacles encountered (what worked, what didn't)

Blue team documentation:
- Alerts triggered (or not triggered)
- Investigation steps taken
- Response actions executed
- Communication records
- Decisions made and reasoning

Purple team documentation:
- Timeline of events
- What was supposed to be detected vs. what was
- Gaps identified in real-time
- Questions to explore in debrief

## Post-engagement

Technical report: Detailed findings, TTPs used, detection gaps, evidence collected

Executive summary: High-level results, business risk implications, improvement priorities

Lessons learned: What worked, what didn't, what to change for next time

Action items: Specific improvements with owners and deadlines

Metrics: Detection rates, response times, coverage statistics
