# Feedback and learning

Purple teaming's value comes from converting findings into improvements. Structured feedback loops ensure learning happens.

## Structured debrief process

Timeline reconstruction: Walk through exercise chronologically. What happened when? What was detected?

Gap identification: Where did detection fail? Where was response slow or incorrect?

Root cause analysis: Why did gaps exist? Tool limitations? Process failures? Training needs?

Improvement prioritisation: What fixes provide most risk reduction? Quick wins vs. long-term projects?

## Red → Blue: Turning attacks into defences

TTP documentation: Red team provides complete technical details of all techniques used.

Detection opportunities: Identify specific points where blue team could have detected activity.

Rule creation: Convert red team IOCs into detection rules, correlation logic, hunt hypotheses.

Playbook updates: Add newly discovered attack patterns to response procedures.

## Blue → Red: Defence-led emulation priorities

Visibility gaps: Blue team identifies blind spots where red team should focus testing.

New tool validation: After deploying new security controls, blue team requests targeted testing.

Threat intelligence integration: Blue team shares threat intel that red team emulates.

Defensive wins: Blue team highlights effective controls red team should attempt to evade.

## Building a learning culture

Blameless post-mortems: Focus on systemic improvements, not individual fault.

Psychological safety: Safe to report failures and gaps without fear of punishment.

Celebrate discoveries: Finding gaps through purple teaming is success, not failure.

Share knowledge: Document lessons learned, share with broader team, build organisational memory.
