# Maturity progression

Purple team capability matures over time. Understand where you are and plan progression.

## Level 1: Ad-hoc testing (Initial)

Characteristics:
- Occasional one-off security tests
- No structured approach
- Limited documentation
- Minimal coordination between red and blue

Capabilities:
- Basic vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing reports
- Reactive security improvements

Next steps:
- Establish regular testing cadence
- Document objectives and scope
- Begin red/blue collaboration

## Level 2: Structured exercises (Developing)

Characteristics:
- Quarterly or semi-annual purple team exercises
- Defined objectives and scope
- Post-exercise debriefs
- Tracked improvement items

Capabilities:
- MITRE ATT&CK aligned testing
- Detection coverage mapping
- Documented playbooks
- Measurement of basic metrics

Next steps:
- Increase exercise frequency
- Automate common tests
- Build detection engineering capability

## Level 3: Continuous validation (Managed)

Characteristics:
- Monthly exercises or continuous testing
- Automated TTP validation
- Regular detection tuning
- Integrated with change management

Capabilities:
- Automated adversary simulation
- Continuous detection coverage monitoring
- SOAR-driven response automation
- Threat intelligence integration

Next steps:
- Predictive defence based on intel
- Advanced adversary emulation
- Full defensive program integration

## Level 4: Automated adversary emulation (Optimised)

Characteristics:
- Continuous automated testing
- Real-time defensive tuning
- Predictive threat modelling
- Purple team embedded in all security activities

Capabilities:
- Autonomous detection and response
- Proactive threat hunting
- Custom adversary emulation
- Security as code practices

Roadmap for progression:
1. Build visibility and logging (Months 1-3)
2. Establish purple team exercises (Months 3-6)
3. Increase frequency and automation (Months 6-12)
4. Continuous validation (Year 2)
5. Advanced automation (Year 2+)
