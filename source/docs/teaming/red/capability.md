# Building red team capability

Organisations don't need elite hackers on day one. Red team capabilities mature over time. Begin here and use [red and blue capability building](../../learning/cross-training/index.rst) later.

## Starting point

Begin with [Atomic Red Team](https://www.atomicredteam.io/) or similar frameworks: Run pre-built attack simulations to test detection capabilities. No custom exploit development required.

Focus on common attack paths: Test the things attackers actually do: phishing, credential abuse, lateral movement with stolen credentials, privilege escalation through misconfigurations.

Partner with purple team: Start with collaborative exercises where blue team knows attacks are coming and red team shares techniques in real-time.

## Developing capabilities

Learn from threat intelligence: Study real adversary TTPs and replicate them in your environment.

Build custom tooling: Develop organisation-specific attack simulations that test your unique environment and defences.

Expand scope: Progress from pure technical testing to include social engineering, physical access, and supply chain attack simulations.

Increase operational security: Evolve from noisy, obvious tests to stealthy operations that test realistic adversary tradecraft.

## Advanced operations

Full adversary emulation: Replicate specific threat actors end-to-end, from reconnaissance through impact.

Assumed breach scenarios: Start with access and test detection, response, and recovery under realistic compromise conditions.

Purple team automation: Continuous adversary simulation with automated red team testing and blue team tuning.

Purple team as a service: Mature organisations develop internal purple team capabilities that continuously challenge and improve security posture.
