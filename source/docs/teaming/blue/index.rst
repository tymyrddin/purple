Blue team
=====================================

Incidents do and will continue to happen. Set up a security incident response team (SIRT). And a security 
operations team (SOC).

To be better prepared to face security incidents with confidence and a clear action plan (instead of operating in a
panic). And a SOC to defend against security breaches and actively isolate and mitigate security risks.
