# The blue team mission

Blue teams exist to protect organisational assets, detect security incidents, and maintain operational security. Defence isn't passive: it requires active monitoring, hunting, and continuous improvement.

## What blue teaming is

Detection and monitoring: Continuously watching for indicators of compromise, anomalous behaviour, and security events across networks, systems, and applications.

Incident response: Rapidly containing, investigating, and remediating security incidents when they occur. Minimising damage and restoring operations.

Threat hunting: Proactively searching for adversaries who have evaded automated defences. Hypothesis-driven investigation of potential compromises.

Defence hardening: Implementing security controls, patching vulnerabilities, and reducing attack surface based on threat intelligence and lessons learned.

Recovery and resilience: Ensuring systems can recover from incidents. Backup procedures, disaster recovery plans, business continuity.

## What blue teaming is not

Pure compliance: Meeting regulatory checkboxes without ensuring controls actually work against real attacks. Compliance is necessary, not sufficient.

Alert fatigue management: Tuning security systems isn't just about reducing false positives. It's about improving detection of real threats.

Firewall administration: Managing security infrastructure is part of blue teaming, but it's not the whole job. Blue team must think like attackers to anticipate and counter their moves.

Incident forensics alone: Understanding what happened is important, but preventing recurrence and improving defences matters more.
