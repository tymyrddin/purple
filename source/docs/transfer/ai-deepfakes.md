# AI-driven threats & deepfakes: verify, then trust  

**Course description:**

This hands-on, interactive course explores how attackers use AI for voice cloning, deepfake videos, and phishing automation. Through real-world cases, simulations, and roleplay, you’ll learn verification techniques to spot and counter these threats. The course prioritises fun, engagement, and practical learning, with no dry theory or heavy assessments.

## Timetable  

**Session 1: introduction to AI-driven threats (60 mins)**  

- Overview of AI in cyber threats: voice cloning, deepfakes, phishing automation.  
- Real-world cases: ceo fraud, fake video calls, political disinformation.  
- Activity: "spot the fake" – quick quiz on AI-generated vs. authentic content.  

**Session 2: deepfake deep dive (90 mins)**  

- How deepfakes are made (simplified technical breakdown).  
- Real-world examples: manipulated videos, audio scams.  
- Hands-on activity: "is this real?" – compare AI-generated and authentic messages/videos.  
- Verification techniques: call-back protocols, multi-factor checks, metadata analysis.  

**Break (15 mins)**  

**Session 3: phishing automation & voice cloning (90 mins)** 

- How attackers use AI to scale phishing campaigns.  
- Voice cloning: how it works and how to detect it.  
- Roleplay: "the suspicious call" – participants practise verifying a cloned voice request.  

**Lunch (30 mins)**  

**Session 4: the big exercise – red team vs. blue team (120 mins, optional)**  

- Based on a real-world AI-driven attack (e.g., a ceo fraud case).  
- Red team: designs a deepfake or AI-phishing attack.  
- Blue team: devises detection and response strategies.  
- Debrief: what worked, what didn’t, and key takeaways.  

**Session 5: "verify, then trust" checklist (45 mins)**  

- Building a personal and organisational verification framework.  
- Fun quiz: "can you beat the AI?" – test your skills in spotting fakes.  
- Q&A and wrap-up.

## Resources required  

- Sample deepfake videos and audio clips (pre-prepared).  
- Phishing email examples (AI-generated vs. real).  
- Roleplay scripts for voice cloning exercise.  
- Slides with real-world case studies.  
- Access to a video/audio editing tool (basic, for demonstration).  
- Printed/digital "verify, then trust" checklists.  

---  

## Key activities explained  

1. **"Is this real?" simulation**  
   - Participants compare AI-generated content with real examples in small groups.  
   - Discuss clues (e.g., unnatural speech patterns, odd lighting in videos).  

2. **Roleplay: the suspicious call**  
   - One participant plays an attacker using voice cloning to request sensitive data.  
   - Another must use verification techniques (e.g., call-back protocols) to confirm legitimacy.  

3. **Red team vs. blue team exercise**  
   - *Scenario:* A company receives a fake video call from a "senior executive" asking for a fund transfer.  
   - Red team designs the attack (script, fake video, or audio).  
   - Blue team detects and responds (e.g., checks with another executive, analyses the video).

## Takeaways  

- A personalised "verify, then trust" checklist.  
- Confidence in identifying AI-driven threats.  
- Practical experience through roleplay and simulations.  
- A completion certificate (no pass/fail).

## Notes for facilitators  

- Keep the tone light and engaging.  
- Encourage participation but no pressure.  
- Adapt real-world cases to the audience’s industry.  
- For virtual delivery, use breakout rooms for group activities.  

This course is designed to be memorable, practical, and fun—because the best learning happens when people enjoy themselves.
