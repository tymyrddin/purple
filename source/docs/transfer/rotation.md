# "Tour of Duty" rotation programme
 
*Building adversarial empathy through immersive cross-team exchanges*  

---

## Programme overview  

A structured 4-6 week rotation where security professionals temporarily join opposing teams to:  
- Experience real operational challenges first-hand  
- Develop mutual understanding between attackers and defenders  
- Create direct feedback channels for tool and process improvement  

---

## Core objectives  

1. **Break down silos**  
   - Red team members experience blue team alert fatigue  
   - Blue team members understand attacker time pressures  
   - Developers witness how security tools perform in real incidents  

2. **Accelerate learning**  
   - Replace theoretical knowledge with muscle memory  
   - Discover undocumented system behaviours  
   - Build institutional knowledge of attack/defence trade-offs  

3. **Improve tooling**  
   - Direct developer feedback from frontline users  
   - Identify critical workflow pain points  
   - Co-create solutions with cross-team input

## Rotation structure  

**Pre-rotation preparation (1 week)**  
- Required reading:  
  - For red→blue rotations: IR playbooks and SIEM documentation  
  - For blue→red rotations: attack frameworks and tool manuals  
- Lab setup:  
  - Access to restricted environments (sandboxed production clones)  
  - Shadowing sessions with rotation mentors  

**Core rotation (3-4 weeks)**  
- **Week 1:** Observation and assisted tasks  
- **Week 2-3:** Primary role execution with supervision  
- **Week 4:** Independent contribution  

**Post-rotation (1 week)**  
- Written lessons learned report  
- Presentation to leadership  
- Implementation plan for identified improvements

## Sample rotations  

**Red team → Blue team**  
- Tasks:  
  - Triage real security alerts  
  - Author detection rules  
  - Participate in incident response  
- Deliverable:  
  - Proposal for evading current detection stack  

**Blue team → Red team**  
- Tasks:  
  - Execute controlled attacks  
  - Develop custom tooling  
  - Participate in threat modelling  
- Deliverable:  
  - Gap analysis of defensive coverage  

**Developers → Frontline teams**  
- Tasks:  
  - Observe tool usage in real investigations  
  - Collect usability feedback  
  - Debug performance issues  
- Deliverable:  
  - Roadmap for tool improvements  

---

## Success metrics  

- **Quantitative:**  
  - 30% reduction in false positives (from red team feedback)  
  - 25% faster mean time to detect (from blue team insights)  
  - 40% increase in tool adoption (from developer rotations)  

- **Qualitative:**  
  - Improved cross-team communication  
  - More realistic training scenarios  
  - Stronger shared mental models  

---

## Implementation checklist  

1. Secure leadership buy-in for time commitments  
2. Develop rotation playbooks for each path  
3. Establish non-disclosure agreements  
4. Create safe-fail environments  
5. Schedule regular debrief sessions

## Lessons from early adopters  

- **Do:**  
  - Start with volunteer participants  
  - Focus on concrete deliverables  
  - Protect rotation time from BAU work  

- **Avoid:**  
  - Treating as a punishment detail  
  - Overloading with administrative tasks  
  - Skipping the post-rotation follow-through  

This programme turns "us vs them" mentalities into collaborative security partnerships through structured perspective-taking.
