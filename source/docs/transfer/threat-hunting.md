# Gamified threat hunting project - find flaws, earn glory  

**Project description:** 

This interactive programme transforms vulnerability reporting into an engaging team sport. Through bug bounty simulations, capture-the-flag challenges, and friendly competition, employees will develop threat-hunting skills while improving organisational security. No prior expertise required - just curiosity and competitive spirit.

## Project structure  

**Duration:** 4-week programme (1-2 hours weekly engagement)  

**Format:** Blended (self-paced challenges + live team events)  

**Audience:** All employees, with separate tracks for technical and non-technical staff  

---  

## Weekly schedule  

**Week 1: threat hunting basics**

- Introduction to vulnerability types (web, mobile, physical, social)  
- How bug bounty programmes work (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd)  
- Activity: "spot the flaw" - analyse mock systems for obvious vulnerabilities  

**Week 2: the hunter toolkit** 

- Basic tools for technical staff (Burp Suite, Nmap walkthroughs)  
- Non-technical hunting (social engineering recognition, physical security checks)  
- Challenge: "first blood" - first person to report a planted vulnerability wins  

**Week 3: live team competition** 

- Capture-the-flag challenge with realistic corporate environment simulation  
- Special categories: most creative find, best documentation, quickest response  

**Week 4: red team vs blue team showcase** 

- Optional exercise based on 2022 Uber breach (external contractor credentials misuse)  
- Awards ceremony with "security champion" certificates  

---  

## Resources required  

- Vulnerable by design applications (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop)  
- Mock corporate environment (test instance of internal tools with planted flaws)  
- Reporting portal for submissions (can use modified ticketing system)  
- Cheat sheets for common vulnerability types  
- Physical security checklist cards  

---  

## Key activities  

1. **"Vulnerability bingo"**  
   - Participants receive cards with different flaw types to discover  
   - First to complete a line wins (e.g., XSS, misconfigured permissions, phishing email)  

2. **Red team vs blue team exercise**  
   - Based on 2023 LastPass phishing attack  
   - Red team attempts to plant fake credentials in mock systems  
   - Blue team hunts for and reports these implants  

3. **"Report like a pro" challenge**  
   - Teams compete to write the most effective vulnerability report  
   - Judged on clarity, reproducibility and risk assessment  

---  

## Rewards system  

- Digital badges for different achievement levels  
- "Security champion" certificates for top performers  
- Leaderboard showing most valuable finds  
- Non-monetary rewards (e.g., security-themed merchandise)  

---  

## Implementation notes  

- For technical staff: Focus on code review and system testing  
- For non-technical staff: Emphasise physical and social engineering finds  
- Ensure all activities occur in test environments only  
- Include "responsible disclosure" training component  

This project proves security can be both serious and fun - where every participant becomes an extra layer of defence.
