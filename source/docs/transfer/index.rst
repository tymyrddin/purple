Organisational knowledge transfer
=============================================

Organisations often struggle with peoples' engagement in information security and privacy,
resulting in people not being aware of the important role they play.

Enable organisations to create truly mature security awareness programs. After a lack of resources, time, and
support by leadership, people are still the weakest link. Raising security awareness requires that users:

* Know the most common vulnerabilities
* Recognise when being attacked
* Realise that one can be attacked at any time
* Have the ability to respond during a real incident
* Recognise the importance of cybersecurity
* Can participate in building resilience
