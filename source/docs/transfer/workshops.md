# Fun experiential workshops

Learning goes best when it [is made fun](https://uu.tymyrddin.dev/games/), takes one day, is done off-site, and includes discussing experiences.

The main idea behind the phrase experiential learning is building upon what one knows to expand that knowledge into action. This means learning comes in part from what experiences and opportunities arise for a person. Put simply, experiential learning is the process of learning through [hands-on experience](https://uu.tymyrddin.dev/labs/). 

Experiential learning is one of the most beneficial types of learning because one gets out of an experience what one puts in. It allows people to better retain what is learned and teaches lessons that can be used for raising awareness.

That which was experienced can not be unexperienced.
