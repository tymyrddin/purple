# Biometric authentication risks: beyond fingerprints and selfies  

**Course description:** 

This practical course explores the hidden vulnerabilities in biometric systems—from facial recognition spoofing to fingerprint replication. Developers will learn attack methods, multi-factor backup strategies, and real-world mitigation techniques through hands-on demos, roleplay, and team challenges. Designed to be engaging, not intimidating, with no tests or pressure—just collaborative learning.

## Course outline  

**Duration:** 1 day (6 hours, including breaks)  

**Format:** In-person or virtual (adaptable for both)  

**Audience:** Developers, security engineers, and product teams implementing biometric auth.  

---  

## Timetable  

**Session 1: biometrics unpacked (60 mins)**  

- How biometric authentication really works (technical but accessible).  
- Real-world failures: masked faces fooling recognition, gummy fingerprints, deepfake bypasses.  
- Activity: "guess the flaw" – match attack types to famous breaches (e.g., android face unlock spoofs).  

**Session 2: hands-on hacking (90 mins)**  

- Demo: bypassing phone face recognition with photos/masks (ethical, controlled environment).  
- Tools: intro to presentation attack tools (e.g., silicone fingerprints, infrared photos for liveness checks).  
- Countermeasures: liveness detection, 3D mapping, and hardware security modules.  

**Break (15 mins)**  

**Session 3: designing resilient systems (90 mins)**  

- Why biometrics should never stand alone: multifactor backups (tokens, behavioural analytics).  
- Roleplay: "the biometric breach" – teams argue for/against replacing passwords in a mock product meeting.  
- Case study: when biometric databases leak (e.g., india’s aadhaar data exposure).  

**Lunch (30 mins)**  

**Session 4: red team vs. blue team (120 mins, optional)**  

- Based on the 2019 samsung galaxy s10 ultrasonic fingerprint spoof.  
- Red team: crafts attacks using everyday materials (e.g., glue, graphite).  
- Blue team: implements detection rules or fallback auth protocols.  
- Debrief: creative attack vectors and defence trade-offs.  

**Session 5: future-proofing auth (45 mins)**  

- Emerging tech: gait analysis, vein patterns, and their risks.  
- Quiz: "spot the weak link" – evaluate real product biometric implementations.  
- Q&A and "biometric myth-busting" wrap-up.  

**Certificates:** Awarded to all participants (no scoring).

## Resources required  

- Demo kits: phone with face unlock, silicone fingerprint moulds (ethical use only).  
- Pre-recorded spoofing examples (e.g., deepfake video bypassing liveness checks).  
- Leaked biometric dataset examples (anonymised, for educational discussion).  
- Roleplay cards for product meeting scenario.  
- Quiz slides with real product screenshots.

## Key activities explained  

1. **"Guess the flaw" matching game**  
   - Teams pair famous biometric failures (e.g., cnn’s 3d-printed hand tricking vein scanners) with their root causes.  

2. **Roleplay: the biometric breach**  
   - A "startup ceo" (played by facilitator) insists on going passwordless. Teams debate risks using real breach data.  

3. **Red team vs. blue team exercise**  
   - *Scenario:* A banking app uses fingerprint auth. Red team must bypass it using household items; blue team deploys rate-limiting or secondary auth.

## Takeaways  

- A "biometric risk checklist" for product development.  
- Hands-on experience with spoofing tools (ethically).  
- Understanding of when biometrics enhance—or weaken—security.  
- Completion certificate.  

---  

## Notes for facilitators  

- Stress ethical boundaries: all attacks are demonstrated, not replicated.  
- For virtual sessions, use pre-recorded spoof demos and breakout rooms for roleplay.  
- Encourage absurd ideas in red teaming (e.g., "could a wax nose fool thermal scans?").  

This course turns biometric risks from theoretical worries into tangible, fixable challenges—while keeping laughter in the room.
