Knowledge transfer and IR playbook development
======================================================

  :alt: A stick figure is writing on a giant scroll labeled 'Incident Playbook'. Another stick figure is erasing a step and writing a better one. A third stick figure is adding a 'Post-Mortem Lesson' sticky note to the margin. The playbook is shown as a messy, evolving document, not a pristine book.

Security knowledge transfer is less about dusty binders and more about building a living, shared understanding
across a team or organisation. It moves beyond static manuals that nobody reads and instead focuses on playbooks
where teams collaboratively tackle real-world scenarios. These hands-on processes are supported by clear
dashboards that make threats and responsibilities visible to everyone, turning abstract policies into practical,
day-to-day actions.
