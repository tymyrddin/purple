# Dashboards & workflows

Knowledge transfer is useless if it sits in PDFs. Dashboards and workflows bring playbooks to life:  

* Dashboards: Real-time visibility of [key metrics](../sirt-and-soc/metrics.md), aligned to playbooks.  
* Workflows: Integrated in ticketing, SIEM, SOAR, or chatops systems.  
* Cross-team visibility: Everyone sees the same picture, reducing finger-pointing.  

## Benefits

* Faster onboarding: New team members ramp up quickly with embedded workflows.  
* Reduced error rate: Steps are explicit and automated where possible.  
* Continuous improvement: Each incident enriches the dashboards and workflows.  

Workflows connect knowledge to action, ensuring lessons learned turn into lessons applied.
