# Detection & response playbooks

Playbooks bridge the gap between abstract policy and real-world action. They answer: *“What do we do when this happens?”*  

## Types of playbooks

* Detection playbooks: Queries, rules, and triggers for identifying suspicious activity.  
* Response playbooks: Step-by-step procedures for investigation, containment, and recovery.  
* Escalation playbooks: Who to call, how, and when.  

## Format

Each playbook is structured for speed:  

* Trigger: What kicks this off?  
* Steps: Who does what, in what order.  
* Decision points: How to choose between containment, escalation, or monitoring.  
* Tools: Queries, scripts, dashboards ready to run.  

Playbooks are designed [to be tested in exercises and updated with each iteration](../learning/incident-response/choreography.md).
