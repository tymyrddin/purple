# Dashboards that actually get used

A dashboard that looks impressive in a demo but is ignored during an incident is not a dashboard; it is decor. 
Dashboards must answer three questions instantly:

1. Is something wrong?
2. Where is it happening?
3. How bad is it?

If analysts cannot answer these at a glance, the dashboard has failed its only job.

## What good dashboards look like

### The “smoke alarm”

A brutally simple view showing:

* Three to five critical indicators
* Clear thresholds and severity
* A single screen without scrolling
* Immediate visual cues for “stop everything” moments

If you need a manual to read the dashboard, bin it.

### The “where is the fire?”

A situational board that shows:

* Affected systems
* Likely propagation paths
* Status of containment
* Alert volume trends
* Hotspots and bottlenecks

This is the board everyone naturally gravitates to during a live incident.

### The “posture snapshot”

A calm-day dashboard for spotting slow-moving disasters:

* Patch coverage
* Endpoint gaps
* Backup health
* Unusual authentication patterns
* Data ingestion issues

This is where tomorrow’s breach quietly announces itself.

## Design principles for dashboards

1. Zero friction: No nested menus, no tooltips, no scavenger hunts.
2. Human-first: Colour only where it matters, minimal clutter, no vanity charts.
3. Operational, not political: Executives get their own dashboard; this one is for people doing real work.
4. Instant refresh: If the threat moves faster than your updates, the dashboard is ornamental.

## Where dashboards must live

* On a wall in the SOC
* On every analyst’s second monitor
* In a pinned tab, always open
* On a TV in the incident room

Dashboards that are hard to reach become dashboards nobody reaches for.
