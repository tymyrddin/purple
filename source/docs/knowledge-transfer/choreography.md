# Overview and basics

Most lessons learned from incidents vanish into dusty reports or forgotten post-mortems. Teams stumble on the same problems again and again because knowledge is not captured in a usable, living form.  

This track flips that script: we turn hard-earned lessons from exercises and incidents into practical manuals, detection playbooks, dashboards, and workflows. Resources that teams can grab, adapt, and extend as they grow, rotate roles, or face new adversaries.  

## Core principles

* Actionable, not archival: Playbooks must be used in the heat of the moment, not shelved.  
* Tailored, not generic: Built from your own scenarios and incidents, not vendor boilerplate.  
* Living documents: Easy to update as threats evolve and teams change.  
* Role-friendly: Clear enough for new joiners, detailed enough for seasoned responders.  
* Transferable: Formats that survive staff turnover and team rotation.  

## How it works

We follow a structured flow:

1. Capture: Extract lessons from incidents, simulations, and exercises.  
2. Translate: Turn findings into step-by-step workflows, playbooks, and guides.  
3. Visualise: Build dashboards and quick-reference tools for real-time use.  
4. Share: Make resources accessible across teams and roles.  
5. Evolve: Regular reviews keep playbooks sharp and relevant.  

## Outputs

* Playbooks for incident detection, triage, and escalation.  
* Role-specific quick-reference guides.  
* Dashboards aligned with team workflows.  
* Resilient knowledge base: living, usable, and ready for the next crisis.  

## Who it is for

* Security and IT teams tired of re-learning the same lessons.  
* Organisations with rotating staff or shared responsibilities.  
* Leadership looking for assurance that knowledge survives turnover.
