# Practical manuals

Not everyone in a crisis has time to parse a wiki. Manuals distil the essentials into usable guides:  

* Checklists for common failure scenarios.  
* Quick-start guides for critical tools (log analysis, SIEM queries, secure comms).  
* Continuity guides for rotating roles: “If X is out, here’s how to cover.”  

## Core principles

* Concise: One page beats ten.  
* Visual: Diagrams and flowcharts trump paragraphs.  
* Role-specific: Tailored to functions, not generic templates.  

Manuals serve as anchors during chaos, ensuring no team member is left improvising without a map.
