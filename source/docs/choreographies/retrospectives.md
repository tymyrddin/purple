# Temperature reading retrospectives & continuous learning

*Inspired by Virginia Satir’s Temperature Reading, expanded with timelines for real organisational retrospectives*

This choreography combines a factual sequence of events, the team’s shifting energy, and a structured reflection 
process. It grounds discussion in reality, captures both what happened and how it was experienced, and turns that 
into actionable learning.

## The flow

1. **Timeline of events** — map the key milestones, decisions, and incidents.
2. **Energy timeline** — layer in how the team’s energy rose and dipped along the way.
3. **Temperature reading** — reflect on what went well, what did not, what was learned, open questions, and next actions.

The result is a retrospective that surfaces hidden dynamics, strengthens collective insight, and builds the capacity 
for continuous learning and the next choreographies.
