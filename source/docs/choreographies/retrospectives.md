# Temperature reading retrospectives & continuous learning

*Inspired by Virginia Satir’s Temperature Reading, adapted for organisational retrospectives*

The Temperature Reading retrospective is a structured way to take the pulse of a team or organisation. It allows 
participants to reflect on past actions, surface friction points, extract learning, and identify knowledge gaps — 
all in a safe, non-judgemental space. The process encourages honest observation, collective insight, and actionable 
planning, helping organisations evolve their practices and improve operational security, collaboration, and 
decision-making. The below is only the core process. It can be made quite fun.

## What went well?

Purpose: Focus on successes first to acknowledge achievements and establish a positive baseline.

Implementation:

* Invite participants to share specific observations of productive behaviours, successful decisions, or effective teamwork.
* Encourage examples at both macro and micro levels — from overall project milestones to small interactions that improved workflow.
* Avoid vague statements; the value comes from details that can be repeated or scaled.

Outcome: Creates awareness of strengths, validates effective practices, and motivates the team.

## What did not go so well?

Purpose: Identify challenges and obstacles, focusing on facts rather than blame or conjecture.

Implementation:

* Ask participants to report specific occurrences, not opinions or judgements.
* Encourage reflection on process inefficiencies, miscommunication, resource bottlenecks, or unclear responsibilities.
* Avoid prematurely offering solutions; let the facts surface before deciding on improvements.

Outcome: Surfaces real issues, clarifies pain points, and prepares the team to formulate targeted actions.

## What have I learned?

Purpose: Extract insights from both successes and failures, building organisational memory.

Implementation:

* Invite participants to reflect on patterns, behaviours, or decisions that taught them something new about processes, collaboration, or security practices.
* Encourage consideration of both technical and human factors, such as how communication influenced outcomes or how security measures impacted workflow.

Outcome: Captures knowledge for the team, highlights opportunities for embedding learning, and encourages reflective practice.

## What still puzzles me?

Purpose: Surface uncertainties, unanswered questions, or gaps in understanding.

Implementation:

* Encourage participants to articulate questions or ambiguities about processes, priorities, or outcomes.
* Promote discussion on risks, unknowns, and emerging challenges that require further exploration.
* Frame these as open-ended questions rather than complaints to avoid defensiveness and generate curiosity.

Outcome: Identifies blind spots, drives inquiry, and creates a list of topics for deeper investigation or monitoring.

## Identify actions

Purpose: Convert observations and insights into practical, prioritised improvements.

Implementation:

* Review all items from the previous four steps and select 2–3 high-impact actions for follow-up.
* Assign ownership, deadlines, and metrics for success where possible.
* Ensure actions are realistic and achievable; overloading the team undermines follow-through.
* Encourage iterative adjustment — actions can be refined based on outcomes from the next retrospective.

Outcome: Creates a tangible improvement plan, reinforces accountability, and supports continuous development of team processes and security practices.

## Notes for Facilitation:

* Maintain psychological safety throughout the session; no one should fear reprisal for honest input.
* Use visual cues or colour coding to represent emotional intensity or confidence levels (e.g., high concern, caution, positive).
* Integrate with quarterly improvement cycles for strategic alignment, or use in shorter sprints for operational adjustments.
* Applicable across small start-ups to mid-sized teams implementing minimal SIRT functions, and larger organisations moving toward SOCs or cross-team security integration.
