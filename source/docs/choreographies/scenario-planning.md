# Scenario planning (looking forward) sketch

*Explore plausible futures, stress-test strategies, and spot potholes before you drive into them—always face-to-face, collaboratively, and with what most digital frameworks ignore.*

This choreography helps teams peek around the corner of tomorrow while acknowledging human limits, 
blind spots, and the state of the world. It combines structured foresight with *obliviousness and 
congruence*: surfacing assumptions, misalignments, and gaps between expectation and reality.

## The flow

1. **Define the focal issue** — choose the core question or challenge your organisation wants to explore.
2. **Identify driving forces** — map external factors (technological, economic, political, social) shaping the future.
3. **Spot critical uncertainties** — surface unknowns that could radically alter outcomes.
4. **Develop scenarios** — sketch distinct, plausible futures.
5. **Build narratives** — craft vivid stories showing how events, behaviours, and consequences might unfold in each scenario.
6. **Reflect and act** — explore implications, plan strategic responses, and prepare for multiple possible futures.
7. **Monitor & adapt** — track trends and revisit assumptions, keeping strategies responsive and alive.

Each step produces valuable insight on its own, yet together they create a robust, self-correcting foresight 
practice. By making assumptions, gaps, and incongruences visible, teams gain confidence in navigating 
uncertainty—without the illusion of omniscience.
