Other facilitated choreographies
============================================

  :alt: A dynamic, photorealistic wide-angle scene of an intense strategy workshop. The room is a hive of collaborative chaos, featuring multiple whiteboards and flip charts covering the walls. One board shows a detailed backward planning diagram with state boxes and action arrows on sticky notes. Another displays a sprawling scenario planning matrix with branches labeled "Best Case," "Worst Case," and "Wild Card." A third captures a retrospective energy timeline with colorful, squiggly graphs. Participants are clustered around each station—gesturing, discussing, and adding new notes. Tables are strewn with markers, scattered post-its, coffee cups, and laptops.

Instead of handing out rigid playbooks, we work with teams through choreographies: stepwise, face-to-face movements
that surface obstacles before they appear. These are not the familiar linear processes with their tidy diagrams and
false sense of certainty. They are looping and adaptive: as you move through them, new dependencies, blind spots,
or risks will emerge, and the choreography shifts in response.

What sets them apart is the inclusion of what most frameworks ignore—obliviousness and congruence in scenario
planning, timelines that reflect human energy rather than just project milestones, and human-based obstacle avoidance
steering built in from the very start. And because no one does this alone, “choreographies” emphasises the
collaborative nature: coordinated, rehearsed, and adjusted together, in the room, not on a screen.
