Other facilitated choreographies
============================================

Starts with desired state and work in reverse towards currently-perceived-state to identify the actions, dependencies,
and potential obstacles along the way. We provide stepwise methodologies, guides, and templates to anticipate
challenges and plan contingencies. This ensures your organisation progresses effectively toward its goals while
avoiding common pitfalls.

Note: These are not a linear processes. They are iterative and dynamic: as you walk through them, new dependencies,
risks, or insights may emerge, requiring adjustments. The process loops, revisits, and adapts continuously
rather than following a straight line. Nor does one go through them alone. Hence the rewording to "choreographies".
