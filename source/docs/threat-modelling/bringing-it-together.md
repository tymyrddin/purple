# Bringing it together

Link personas, attack paths, and impacts.

## Goal
Move from isolated exercises to a living threat model
your organisation can update and revisit.

## Exercise instructions
1. Combine your adversary personas with mapped attack paths.  
2. Add the operational impacts for each path.  
3. Prioritise: which risks are unacceptable, which can be tolerated?  
4. Decide on next steps: mitigations, monitoring, or simply awareness.  

## Result
A threat model that reflects real risks, grounded in team discussion,
and ready to guide future decisions.
