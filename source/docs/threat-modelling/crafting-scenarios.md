# Crafting scenarios

Turn attack paths and impacts into realistic, usable scenarios.

## Why scenario exercises matter
Scenarios make abstract risks concrete.
They help teams visualise how adversaries might operate,
how systems and people are affected, and where mitigations are needed.

## Exercise instructions
1. Take one or two attack paths from the previous exercise.  
2. Write a short scenario including:  
   - Adversary persona  
   - Sequence of moves  
   - Operational impact  
3. Optionally, swap scenarios with a partner and identify:  
   - Weak points  
   - Overlooked risks  
4. Keep each scenario concise, one page or card.

## Outcome
Concrete scenarios that highlight
how attacks could unfold in practice,
making risks easier to understand and communicate.
