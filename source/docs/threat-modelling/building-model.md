# Building a model

Consolidate insights into a practical, reusable threat model.

## Why building a model matters
A threat model turns scattered exercises into a structured picture.
It allows teams to see patterns, prioritise risks,
and plan mitigation in a coherent way.

## Exercise instructions
1. Review all previous exercises: adversaries, attack paths, impacts, scenarios.  
2. Organise findings into a model with sections:  
   - Adversaries  
   - Attack paths  
   - Operational impacts  
   - Mitigations  
3. Make the model understandable by someone not in the exercise.  
4. Highlight the top 2–3 risks and key lessons learned.

## Outcome
You can produce a lightweight, actionable threat model
that captures realistic threats and operational consequences,
ready to inform planning and decision-making.
