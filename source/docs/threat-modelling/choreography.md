# Introduction to steps

Experiment with adversary behaviour, attack paths, and operational risks.

## Why these exercises matter
Threats are easier to understand when you see them in action.
These exercises help teams connect adversary actions to real-world impact,
turning abstract risks into concrete insights that guide planning and mitigation.

## How to use this set
1. Work through the exercises in order: Adversary personas → mapping moves → attack paths → operational impact → bringing it together → crafting scenarios → building your model.  
2. Focus on practical outputs, not theory.  
3. Collaborate and discuss: different perspectives reveal hidden risks.  
4. Keep it simple—use one sheet, one card, or one diagram per exercise.

## Outcome
By the end of this series, you will have:  
- Clear adversary personas  
- Mapped attack paths  
- Operational impact insights  
- Realistic scenarios  
- A lightweight, actionable threat model  

This is a toolkit for hands-on exploration, not a manual. Iterate, adapt, and learn from what unfolds.
