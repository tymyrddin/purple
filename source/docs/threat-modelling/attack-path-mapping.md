# Attack path mapping

Trace how an adversary could move through your systems.

## Why attack paths matter
Threats rarely succeed in one step. They usually follow a chain:
an entry point, some pivoting, and a final target. Mapping this out
shows where to defend.

## Exercise instructions
1. Choose one adversary persona.
2. Draw the possible entry points on a whiteboard or sticky notes.
3. Extend paths step by step: what would they try next?
4. Stop when you reach an asset that would hurt if lost, stolen, or disrupted.

## Quick tips
- Keep it simple: you want a sketch, not a compliance report.  
- Highlight chokepoints â€” the steps that appear in multiple attack paths.  
- Chokepoints are often the most efficient places to strengthen defences.
