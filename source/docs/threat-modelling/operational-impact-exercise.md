# Operational impact exercise

Explore what happens if an attack succeeds.

## Why impact exercises matter
A system failure or breach is not just about data.
It disrupts operations, affects people, and burns resources.
Impact drills connect technical attacks to real-world consequences.

## Exercise instructions
1. Take one attack path from the previous exercise.
2. Imagine it succeeds.  
3. Discuss:  
   - What operations fail?  
   - Who is directly affected?  
   - How long until normal work resumes?  
4. Capture the key risks on one sheet of paper.

## Outcome
This exercise creates a shared map of consequences,
so decision-makers see beyond “IT problems” to
operational risks.
