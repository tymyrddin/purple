# From exercises to operations

You've built a risk register and process. Now make it operational.

## Integration points

With [ISO 27001](../audits/iso27001/index.rst) implementation:
- Your risk register feeds control selection (Annex A)
- Risk assessment documentation satisfies Clause 6.1
- Risk treatment plans become your implementation roadmap
- Risk reviews inform management reviews

With [NIS2](../audits/nis2/index.rst) compliance:
- Critical assets identified map to Article 21 requirements
- Risk assessment supports "appropriate and proportionate" measures
- Treatment plans address mandatory security measures
- Register demonstrates systematic risk management

With incident response:
- Known risks have response plans ready
- Incidents trigger risk assessment updates
- Post-incident reviews feed back to risk register
- High-impact scenarios drive tabletop exercises

With business continuity:
- Asset dependencies inform continuity plans
- Impact assessments determine recovery priorities
- Treatment options include continuity controls
- Register identifies single points of failure

## Maturity progression

Level 1: Reactive (You're starting here)
- Risks identified after incidents
- Ad-hoc assessments
- Basic register
- Fire-fighting mode

Level 2: Structured (Next 3-6 months)
- Regular risk identification workshops
- Consistent assessment criteria
- Maintained risk register
- Planned treatment approach

Level 3: Integrated (6-12 months)
- Risk management embedded in processes
- Automated workflows and reporting
- Proactive risk identification
- Risk-informed decisions

Level 4: Predictive (12+ months)
- Threat intelligence feeds risk model
- Scenario planning and stress testing
- Forward-looking risk metrics
- Risk culture embedded

Don't try to jump to Level 4. Build capability progressively.

## Keeping it alive

Monthly:
- Review Critical risks
- Check treatment progress
- Update based on incidents or changes

Quarterly:
- Review High and Medium risks
- Report to executives
- Adjust treatment priorities
- Capture new risks

Annually:
- Full risk assessment refresh
- Validate likelihood/impact criteria
- Review process effectiveness
- Update appetite and thresholds

As needed:
- New system launches
- Major organisational changes
- Significant incidents
- Regulatory updates
