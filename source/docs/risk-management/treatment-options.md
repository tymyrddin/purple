# What you can do (treatment options)

Duration: 45-60 minutes  

Materials: Your risk matrix, treatment option cards, markers

## The exercise

For each risk above your appetite line, identify what you can actually do about it.

Step 1: Understand your options (10 minutes)

Four basic treatments, for example:

- Treat (Mitigate, Reduce): Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- Accept: Consciously decide to live with the risk (usually low risks)
- Transfer: Share the risk (insurance, contracts, outsourcing)
- Avoid: Change operations to eliminate the risk entirely

Step 2: Work through priority risks (30 minutes)

Start with Critical and High risks. For each, brainstorm:

Treat/Mitigate/Reduce options:
- What controls could reduce likelihood? (Prevention)
- What could reduce impact if it happens? (Protection/Detection/Response)
- What is the effort/cost?
- How long to implement?

Transfer options:
- Can insurance cover this?
- Can contracts pass responsibility to suppliers?
- Can we share the risk?

Avoid options:
- Can we stop doing the risky thing?
- Can we redesign to eliminate the vulnerability?
- Is avoidance realistic?

Accept:
- What are our conscious acceptance criteria?
- Who needs to approve acceptance?
- What is our monitoring plan?

Write treatment options on cards, linking to specific risks.

Step 3: Reality check (10 minutes)

For proposed treatments:
- Is this actually feasible?
- Do we have budget/resources?
- What is the timeline?
- Does this create new risks?

Be honest. "We should implement MFA" is not a plan if you have no budget or skills.

Step 4: Prioritise treatments (10 minutes)

You cannot do everything at once. Prioritise based on:
- Risk severity (Critical first)
- Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
- Dependencies (what must happen first)
- Available resources
- Compliance requirements

Create a rough implementation order.

## Output

- Treatment options for each priority risk
- Reality-checked for feasibility
- Prioritised implementation order
- Clear ownership for decisions

## Common pitfalls

*"Only technical solutions"* → Include process, training, contracts

*"Overly ambitious"* → "Implement zero trust architecture" isn't a treatment plan for a small team

*"Treating everything"* → Some risks should be accepted, it's okay

*"No ownership"* → Who actually implements? Who pays?
