# What could break it (vulnerability identification)

Duration: 45-60 minutes  

Materials: Asset cards from previous exercise, new cards for vulnerabilities, markers

## The exercise

For each critical asset, identify specific ways it could fail, be compromised, or become unavailable.

Step 1: Pick an asset (5 minutes)

Start with your most critical asset. Focus on one at a time.

Step 2: Brainstorm vulnerabilities (15 minutes per asset)

Ask: What could go wrong? Think about:

- Technical weaknesses: Unpatched systems, weak authentication, no backups, single points of failure, insecure configurations
- Process failures: No change control, missing documentation, inadequate testing, poor access management
- Human factors: Lack of training, social engineering susceptibility, mistakes under pressure, key person dependencies
- External threats: Supplier failures, cyber attacks, natural disasters, regulatory changes, market disruptions

Write each vulnerability on a card. Be specific: "No MFA on admin accounts" not "weak security."

Step 3: Reality check (10 minutes)

For each vulnerability, ask:
- Does this actually exist? (Verify, don't assume)
- Can this realistically be exploited?
- Have we seen this happen before (here or elsewhere)?

Remove theoretical or irrelevant items. Keep real, current vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Group by type (10 minutes)

Cluster vulnerabilities:
- Technical/infrastructure
- Process/operational
- People/awareness
- Third-party/external

Step 5: Repeat for other critical assets

Work through your top 5-10 assets. You don't need to analyse everything, focus on what matters most.

## Output

- Vulnerabilities mapped to critical assets
- Grouped by type
- Verified as current and realistic
- Specific enough to address

## Common pitfalls

*"Too abstract"* → "Poor security" becomes "No MFA", "Unpatched servers", "No monitoring"

*"Missing operational risks"* → Include process failures, not just technical exploits

*"Everything is a vulnerability"* → Prioritise. What is most likely to be exploited?
