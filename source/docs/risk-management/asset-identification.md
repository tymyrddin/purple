# What matters (asset identification)

Duration: 30-45 minutes

Materials: Index cards or sticky notes, markers, wall or large table

## The exercise

Identify what your organisation depends on to deliver services. Not everything, just what actually matters.

Step 1: Brainstorm assets (10 minutes)

Working individually or in small groups, write down assets on cards. One asset per card. Think broadly:

- Information: Customer data, financial records, intellectual property, operational data
- Systems: Applications, databases, websites, infrastructure, control systems
- Services: Critical business processes, third-party services, supply chains
- People: Key personnel, specialised knowledge, relationships
- Physical: Facilities, equipment, hardware

Step 2: Cluster and categorise (10 minutes)

Group similar assets together. Create categories that make sense for your organisation. Common groupings:

- Customer-facing systems
- Internal operations
- Data repositories
- Infrastructure and platforms
- Third-party dependencies

Step 3: Identify critical assets (15 minutes)

Ask for each asset or group:
- If this was unavailable for a day, what breaks?
- If this was compromised, what's the impact?
- Is this a single point of failure?
- Can we operate without this?

Mark the 10-20 assets that are truly critical. These are your focus.

Step 4: Document dependencies (10 minutes)

For critical assets, note what they depend on:
- What systems does this rely on?
- What data does it need?
- What people manage it?
- What suppliers support it?

## Output

- List of critical assets (10-20 items)
- Categories or groupings
- Key dependencies noted
- Shared understanding of what matters most

## Common pitfalls

*"Everything is critical"* → Force prioritisation. What breaks operations immediately?

*"Too technical"* → Include business perspective, not just IT.

*"Missing context"* → Note why each asset matters (revenue, compliance, safety, etc.).
