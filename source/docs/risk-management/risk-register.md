# Bringing it together (risk register)

Duration: 60 minutes  

Materials: All previous cards and materials, template or spreadsheet

## The exercise

Consolidate your work into a usable risk register that becomes a living document.

Step 1: Create your register structure (10 minutes)

Simple columns work best:

| Risk ID | Asset | Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Treatment | Owner | Status | Review Date |
|---------|-------|---------------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|

Add columns relevant to your context (compliance refs, costs, etc.).

Step 2: Document each risk (30 minutes)

Transfer risks from your matrix systematically:

1. Start with Critical and High risks
2. For each risk, capture:
   - Clear description (asset + vulnerability + potential impact)
   - Current likelihood and impact ratings
   - Calculated risk level
   - Chosen treatment approach
   - Specific actions to implement
   - Owner (person responsible)
   - Target completion date
   - Current status

3. Don't lose the context: Include notes on reasoning, dependencies, assumptions

Step 3: Add metadata (10 minutes)

For each risk:
- Link to relevant policies or standards (ISO 27001 controls, NIS2 requirements)
- Note any compliance obligations
- Flag any risks linked to incidents or near-misses
- Add references to related risks

Step 4: Set review schedule (10 minutes)

Risks change. Build in regular reviews:

- Critical risks: Monthly review
- High risks: Quarterly review
- Medium risks: Semi-annual review
- Low risks: Annual review or as needed

Assign review owners and calendar it.

## Output

- Complete risk register with all priority risks documented
- Clear ownership and timelines
- Review schedule established
- Living document ready for operational use

## Templates and tools

Start simple:
- Spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Shared document with tables
- Project management tool (if you already use one)

Add sophistication later:
- GRC platforms (Archer, ServiceNow, etc.)
- Risk management software
- Integration with ISMS tools

Don't let tools delay action. Start with what you have.

## Common pitfalls

*"Too detailed to maintain"* → Keep it lean. Update when risks change, not continuously

*"No one owns it"* → Assign a risk register owner (often CISO, compliance, or risk manager)

*"Set and forget"* → Schedule reviews and actually do them

*"Disconnected from reality"* → Link to actual incidents, audit findings, control testing
