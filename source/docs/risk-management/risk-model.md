# Building your risk model

Duration: Ongoing  

Materials: Your risk register, organisational context, frameworks

## The exercise

Move from register to model: a repeatable process for identifying, assessing, and managing risks continuously.

Step 1: Document your process (30 minutes)

Write down how you did this:

1. Risk identification: How do you find new risks? (Workshops, audits, incidents, threat intel, regulatory changes)
2. Risk assessment: How do you evaluate them? (Your likelihood/impact criteria)
3. Risk treatment: How do you decide what to do? (Your appetite, prioritisation approach)
4. Risk monitoring: How do you track progress? (Review schedule, reporting)
5. Risk communication: Who needs to know what? (Board reports, operational updates)

This becomes your risk management process.

Step 2: Map to frameworks (optional, 20 minutes)

If you're working towards ISO 27001, NIS2, or other standards, map your process:

- [ISO 27001 risk assessment](../audits/iso27001/risk-tent.md): Your process becomes clause 6.1 (risk assessment) and 6.2 (risk treatment)
- [NIS2 compliance](../audits/nis2/river.md): Your critical asset analysis supports Article 21 (risk analysis requirement)
- Internal audit: Your register provides evidence for control selection
- Board reporting: Your risk summary informs governance oversight

Step 3: Establish triggers for updates (15 minutes)

Don't wait for scheduled reviews. Update your risk register when:

- New systems or services go live
- Security incidents occur
- Audit findings emerge
- Regulatory requirements change
- Major organisational changes happen
- Suppliers change or fail
- Threat landscape shifts

Document these triggers.

Step 4: Build feedback loops (15 minutes)

Connect risk management to operations:

- Incidents → Risk register: Every incident should trigger risk review
- Risk register → Controls: Treatment plans drive control implementation
- Control testing → Risk register: Testing results update risk assessments
- Risk register → Board: Regular reporting keeps leadership informed

Step 5: Start measuring (optional)

Over time, track:
- Number of risks by level
- Treatment progress (% complete)
- Residual risk after treatment
- Time to treat risks
- Risk trend (increasing/decreasing)

These metrics show whether your risk posture is improving.

## Output

- Documented risk management process
- Framework mappings (if needed)
- Defined update triggers
- Established feedback loops
- Measurement approach

## Next steps

Immediate:
1. Share your risk register with stakeholders
2. Get board or executive approval for treatment plans
3. Begin implementing priority treatments
4. Schedule first round of reviews

Near term (1-3 months):
1. Test your process: Does it work in practice?
2. Refine based on feedback
3. Train people on their roles
4. Establish reporting rhythms

Long term (6-12 months):
1. Integrate with ISMS or compliance programmes
2. Automate where beneficial
3. Mature from reactive to proactive
4. Build predictive capabilities

## Common pitfalls

*"Too heavyweight"* → Keep the process as simple as possible while remaining effective

*"Process for process sake"* → Focus on outcomes: are risks being managed?

*"No continuous improvement"* → Learn from what works and does not, iterate

*"Disconnected from strategy"* → Risk management should inform business decisions
