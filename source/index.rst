Purple team (under construction)
======================================================

Functionally, a Purple Team isn't just a colour blend â€” it's the collaborative glue between Red (attackers) and Blue
(defenders) teams. It ensures that offensive insights improve defences and that defensive weaknesses are tested
meaningfully.

Since the Red team is usually a somewhat messy fun of offensive operations, and the Blue is likely structured around
detection, defence, and incident response, the Purple team should own operational synergy: they turn lessons from
attack and defence into better strategy, tooling, and training.

Purple is the force multiplier that turns adversarial insights into resilient defences and strategic growth.
