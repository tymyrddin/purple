Purple team
======================================================

Functionally, a Purple Team isn't just a colour blend â€” it's the collaborative glue between Red (attackers) and Blue
(defenders) teams. It ensures that offensive insights improve defences and that defensive weaknesses are tested
meaningfully.

Since the Red team is usually a somewhat messy fun of offensive operations, and the Blue is likely structured around
detection, defence, and incident response, for best results, the Purple team can own operational synergy: turning
lessons from attack and defence into better strategy, tooling, and training.
