# Introduction

## What?

Writeups made from our adventures in the forest.

## Why?

* Writeups serve as cheatsheets and reminders for future engagements and provide an easy entry level for others. 
* Communication with peers also feels nice and improves collaborating with others and other teams. 
* And what is neater than a well-written perfectly-structured pentesting topic? As if perfectly-structured is possible. 
Pentesting is not easy to structure, because the process is more like a fusion dance. Fusion dancing may involve 
creating a new dance style, recreating an already established dance style, combining existing styles of movement and 
other possibilities we probably haven't thought of yet. 
* And improving communication is also a worthy goal.
